    "# Particle-Field interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates a simple way to make particles interact with a ` Field` object and modify it. The ` Field` will thus change at each step of the simulation, and will be written using the same time resolution as the particle outputs, in as many `netCDF` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is similar to that of [Field sampling](https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/latest/examples/tutorial_sampling.html): here instead, on top of reading the field value at their location, particles are able to alter it as defined in the `Kernel`. To do this, it is important to keep in mind that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Particles have to be defined as `Particles`\n",
    "- `Field` writing at each `outputdt` is not default and has to be enabled\n",
    "- The time of the `Field` to be saved has to be updated within a `Kernel`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, particles will carry a tracer and release it into a clean `Field` during their advection by surface currents. To show how can particles interact with a `Field` and alter it, the exchange of such tracer is modelled here with a discretized version of the mass transfer equation, defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta c*{particle}(t) = aC*{field}(t-1) - bc\\_{particle}(t-1)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In Eq.1, $c_{particle}$ is the tracer concentration associated with the particle, $C_{field}$ is the tracer concentration in seawater at particle location, and $a$ and $b$ are weights that modulate the sorption of tracer from seawater and its desorption, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally to a relevant `Kernel`, we will define a suitable particle class to store $c_{particle}$, as it is needed to solve Eq.1.\n"

Our first guess is `particle.xi[fieldset.C.igrid]`, the location in the particular grid, but it could be that `xi+1` is closer, which is what the `if`-statements are for.\n",
