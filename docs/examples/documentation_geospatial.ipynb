    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "This tutorial goes over converting parcels particle trajectory data into various common geospatial data formats including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shapefile\n",
    "* Geopackage\n",
    "* GeoJSON\n",
    "* KML\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for easy integration of Parcels output with any geospatial workflows you have, or geospatial tools you would like for further visualization and analysis. Geospatial software covered in this tutorial include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GIS Software ([QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) and [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html))\n",
    "* [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)\n",
    "* [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code has been written to make it as \"production ready\" and \"copy pastable\" as possible to help with your workflows. This tutorial also highlights the limitations of some geospatial datasets and tools when it comes to working with large datasets (which parcels tends to output).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tutorial requirements:**  \n",
    "Most of this tutorial requires your simulation is run using longitude and latitude in degrees (as opposed to being in metres).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires the following packages:\n",
    "- [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) to create the geospatial datasets (`conda install -c conda-forge geopandas`)\n",
    "- [lxml](https://lxml.de/) to create KML files for Google Earth (`conda install lxml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial saves all generated data output in a folder `tutorial_geospatial_output` to avoid clogging the working directory."

    "## GIS data types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly two types of geospatial data:\n",
    "* Raster data\n",
    "* Vector data\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this article](https://gisgeography.com/spatial-data-types-vector-raster/) for an explainer of raster vs vector data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various geospatial dataset types exist for raster and vector data. Here we go over a few of them, discussing their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### NetCDF (.nc)\n",
    "A raster data format for storing and sharing large, multi-dimensional arrays of scientific data, often used for gridded climate and oceanographic datasets. May need some processing before visualizing depending on setup of the NetCDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shapefile (.shp, ...)\n",
    "The longest standing geospatial vector data format used for storing location data and associated attribute information. Shapefile is a multifile format, where the dataset is split into files with different extensions handling vector (.shp), indexing (.shx), attribute (.dbf), encoding (.cpg), and projection (.prj) information. The shapefile is a [geospatial data format with many limitations](http://switchfromshapefile.org/) compared to other geospatial data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pros:\n",
    "    - The oldest data format. Has wide adoption across various GIS tools.\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - Limits on:\n",
    "        - variable name lengths (10 characters)\n",
    "        - variable types\n",
    "        - file size (2Gb max)\n",
    "    - No NULL value\n",
    "    - No time data type.\n",
    "    - Can only contain a single layer (i.e. you can't mix geospatial data types in a single file).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoJSON (.geojson)\n",
    "A lightweight, human-readable, vector data format for encoding geospatial data structures, such as points, lines, and polygons, using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Commonly used in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### KML (.kml) and KMZ (.kmz)\n",
    "XML-based vector formats for expressing geographic annotations and visualizations on 2D maps and 3D Earth browsers, such as Google Earth. KMZ is a compressed version of KML.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoPackage (.gpkg)\n",
    "A modern, open, standards-based, platform-independent format for storing geospatial data. Operates using an SQLite database, and is capable of storing multiple layers in a single dataset. Can contain raster and vector layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geodatabase (.gdb)\n",
    "A proprietary Esri format for storing, querying, and managing geospatial data, including vector, raster, and tabular data. This tutorial does not cover Geodatabases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "For geospatial vector datasets, layers can only contain one feature type. Each feature in a geospatial dataset can have associated data (timestamps, text, numeric values) depending on what the data represents. There are 3 types of features in geospatial datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Point:** Describes individual coordinates on earth.\n",
    "- **Linestring:** Describes individual lines on earth (is composed of a sequence of coordinates, which are joined in an open loop).\n",
    "- **Polygon:** Describes individual polygons on earth (is composed of a sequence of coordinates, which are joined in a closed loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here there are two logical choices for representing particle trajectory data, using *points* or *linestrings*. Using points, all the data (including timestamps) is preserved, but the path of the particle may not be inherently evident on the software being used to load the point data. The timestamp information is tied as data for that point, and may not be visualized by the software. Representing trajectories as linestrings makes it easy to visualize trajectories in GIS software, but extra data regarding the individual point observations (i.e. all data except (lon, lat) location data) is lost in this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations mainly apply to Shapefile, GeoJSON, GeoPackage, and Geodatabase formats when used in GIS applications. As explored later, Google Earth (KML) has syntax specifically for visualizing trajectories, and Kepler accepts modified GeoJSON to represent trajectory data.\n"

To avoid loading in huge datasets, we code in some safeguards. If your dataset is too large, it is recommended you subset your `xr.Dataset` to reduce its size before proceeding with converting to the geospatial datasets."
