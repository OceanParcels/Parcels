    "You can see several things in this. It is always quicker to open a single file, and for all data access patterns, there is are chunksizes that are more efficient than the default output. Why is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunksize determines how data is stored on disk. For the default zarr datastore, each chunk of data is stored as a single compressed file. In netCDF, chunking is similar except that the compressed data is stored within a single file. In either case, if you must access any data from within a chunk, you must read the entire chunk from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we access one obs dimension and many trajectories, the chunking scheme that is elongated in the trajectory direction is fastest. When we get all the observation for a scattered set of trajectories, the chunking that is elongated in observations is the best. In general, the product of the two chunksizes (the number of data points in a chunk) should be hundreds of thousands to 10s of millions. A suboptimal chunking scheme is usually not tragic, but if you know how you will most often access the data, you can save considerable time.\n"
