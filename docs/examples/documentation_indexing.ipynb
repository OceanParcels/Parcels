    "Parcels supports `Fields` on any curvilinear `Grid`. For velocity `Fields` (`U`, `V` and `W`), there are some additional restrictions if the `Grid` is discretized as an Arakawa B- or Arakawa C-grid. That is because under the hood, Parcels uses a specific interpolation scheme for each of these grid types. This is described in [Section 2 of Delandmeter and Van Sebille (2019)](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/3571/2019/gmd-12-3571-2019.html) and summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary is: \n",
    "\n",
    "> For Arakawa B-and C-grids, Parcels requires the locations of the _corner_ points (f-points) of the grid cells for the `dimensions` dictionary of velocity `Fields`.\n",
    " \n",
    "In other words, on an Arakawa C-grid, the `[k, j, i]` node of `U` will _not_ be located at position `[k, j, i]` of `U.grid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Barycentric coordinates and indexing in Parcels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arakawa C-grids\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular grid (also called an Arakawa A-grid), the velocities (`U`, `V` and `W`) and tracers (e.g. temperature) are all located in the center of each cell. But hydrodynamic model data is often supplied on staggered grids (e.g. for NEMO, POP and MITgcm), where `U`, `V` and `W` are shifted with respect to the cell centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it simple, let's take the case of a 2D Arakawa C-grid. Zonal (`U`) velocities are located at the east and west faces of each cell and meridional (`V`) velocities at the north and south. The following diagram shows a comparison of 4x4 A- and C-grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Arakawa Grid layouts](images/grid_comparison.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that different models use different indices to relate the location of the staggered velocities to the cell centers. The default C-grid indexing notation in Parcels is the same as for **NEMO** (middle panel): `U[j, i]` is located between the cell corners `[j-1, i]` and `[j, i]`, and `V[j, i]` is located between cell corners `[j, i-1]` and `[j, i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as you've noticed on the grid illustrated on the figure, there are 4x4 cells. The grid providing the cell corners is a 5x5 grid, but there are only 4x5 U nodes and 5x4 V nodes, since the grids are staggered. This implies that the first row of `U` data and the first column of `V` data is never used (and do not physically exist), but the `U` and `V` fields are correctly provided on a 5x5 table. If your original data are provided on a 4x5 `U` grid and a 5x4 `V` grid, you need to regrid your table to follow Parcels notation before creating a FieldSet!\n",
    "\n",
    "**MITgcm** uses a different indexing: `U[j, i]` is located between the cell corners `[j, i]` and `[j+1, i]`, and `V[j, i]` is located between cell corners `[j, i]` and `[j, i+1]`. If you use [xmitgcm](https://xmitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to write your data to a NetCDF file, `U` and `V` will have the same dimensions as your grid (in the above case 4x4 rather than 5x5 as in NEMO), meaning that the last column of `U` and the last row of `V` are omitted. In MITgcm, these either correspond to a solid boundary, or in the case of a periodic domain, to the first column and row respectively. In the latter case, and assuming your model domain is periodic, you can use the `FieldSet.add_periodic_halo` method to make sure particles can be correctly interpolated in the last zonal/meridional cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parcels can take care of loading C-grid data for you, through the general `FieldSet.from_c_grid_dataset` method (which takes a `gridindexingtype` argument), and the model-specific methods `FieldSet.from_nemo` and `FieldSet.from_mitgcm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only information that Parcels needs is the location of the 4 corners of the cell, which are called the $f$-node. Those are the ones provided by `U.grid` (and are equal to the ones in `V.grid`). Parcels does not need the exact location of the `U` and `V` nodes, because in C-grids, `U` and `V` nodes are always located in the same position relative to the $f$-node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the interpolation of velocities on Arakawa C-grids is done in barycentric coordinates: $\\xi$, $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ instead of longitude, latitude and depth. These coordinates are always between 0 and 1, measured from the corner of the grid cell. This is more accurate than simple linear interpolation on curvilinear grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling `FieldSet.from_c_grid_dataset()` or a method that is based on it like `FieldSet.from_nemo()`, Parcels automatically sets the interpolation method for the `U`, `V` and `W` `Fields` to `cgrid_velocity`. With this interpolation method, the velocity interpolation follows the description in [Section 2.1.2 of Delandmeter and Van Sebille (2019)](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/3571/2019/gmd-12-3571-2019.html).\n",

In 3D C-grids, the vertical (`W`) velocities are at the top and bottom.
