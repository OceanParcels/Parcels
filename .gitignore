# Ignore pixi.lock file for this project. The con of 22k lines of noise it adds to diffs is not worth
# the benefit of perfectly reproducible environments for all developers (and all the tooling that would
# be required to support that - see https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/10732#issuecomment-3327780806
