.IX Subsection "New Unicode properties Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type supported"
Unicode has revised its regular expression requirements:
<https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/tr18\-21.html>.
As part of that they are wanting more properties to be exposed, ones
that aren't part of the strict \s-1UCD\s0 (Unicode character database). These
two are used for examining inputs for security purposes. Details on
their usage is at <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/>.
.ie n .SS "It is now possible to write ""qr/\ep{Name=...}/"", or ""qr!\ep{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING) FACE/}!"""
.el .SS "It is now possible to write \f(CWqr/\ep{Name=...}/\fP, or \f(CWqr!\ep{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING) FACE/}!\fP"
.IX Subsection "It is now possible to write qr/p{Name=...}/, or qr!p{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING) FACE/}!"
The Unicode Name property is now accessible in regular expression
patterns, as an alternative to \f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR.
A comparison of the two methods is given in
\&\*(L"Comparison of \eN{...} and \ep{name=...}\*(R" in perlunicode.
.PP
The second example above shows that wildcard subpatterns are also usable
in this property. See \*(L"Wildcards in Property Values\*(R" in perlunicode.
.ie n .SS "Improvement of ""POSIX::mblen()"", ""mbtowc"", and ""wctomb"""
.el .SS "Improvement of \f(CWPOSIX::mblen()\fP, \f(CWmbtowc\fP, and \f(CWwctomb\fP"
.IX Subsection "Improvement of POSIX::mblen(), mbtowc, and wctomb"
The \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::mblen()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`mbtowc\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`wctomb\*(C'\fR functions now
work on shift state locales and are thread-safe on C99 and above
compilers when executed on a platform that has locale thread-safety; the
length parameters are now optional.
.PP
These functions are always executed under the current C language locale.
(See perllocale.)  Most locales are stateless, but a few, notably the
very rarely encountered \s-1ISO 2022,\s0 maintain a state between calls to
these functions. Previously the state was cleared on every call, but
now the state is not reset unless the appropriate parameter is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
On threaded perls, the C99 functions \fBmbrlen\fR\|(3), \fBmbrtowc\fR\|(3), and
\&\fBwcrtomb\fR\|(3), when available, are substituted for the plain functions.
This makes these functions thread-safe when executing on a locale
thread-safe platform.
.PP
The string length parameters in \f(CW\*(C`mblen\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`mbtowc\*(C'\fR are now optional;
useful only if you wish to restrict the length parsed in the source
string to less than the actual length.

Use of these no longer generates a warning; existing code that disables

This is primarily useful for tracking down bugs in the regular
expression compiler. This dump happens on \f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUGGING\*(C'\fR perls, if you
specify \f(CW\*(C`\-Drv\*(C'\fR on the command line; or on any perl if the pattern is
compiled within the scope of \f(CW\*(C`use\ re\ qw(Debug\ DUMP_PRE_OPTIMIZE)\*(C'\fR or

.IX Subsection "[CVE-2020-10543] Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression"
A signed \f(CW\*(C`size_t\*(C'\fR integer overflow in the storage space calculations for
nested regular expression quantifiers could cause a heap buffer overflow in
Perl's regular expression compiler that overwrites memory allocated after the
regular expression storage space with attacker supplied data.
.PP
The target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate partial
expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the overflow occurring.  This
requirement is unlikely to be met on 64\-bit systems.
.PP
Discovered by: ManhND of The Tarantula Team, VinCSS (a member of Vingroup).

.IX Subsection "[CVE-2020-10878] Integer overflow via malformed bytecode produced by a crafted regular expression"
Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between instructions for the
regular expression engine could cause corruption of the intermediate language
state of a compiled regular expression.  An attacker could abuse this behaviour
to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression.
.PP
Discovered by: Hugo van der Sanden and Slaven Rezic.
.SS "[\s-1CVE\-2020\-12723\s0] Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression"

Recursive calls to \f(CW\*(C`S_study_chunk()\*(C'\fR by Perl's regular expression compiler to
optimize the intermediate language representation of a regular expression could
cause corruption of the intermediate language state of a compiled regular
expression.
.PP
Discovered by: Sergey Aleynikov.
.SS "Additional Note"
.IX Subsection "Additional Note"
An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to any of the above
flaws if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker.  Evaluating
regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular
expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this
usage scenario.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"

.SS "Certain pattern matching features are now prohibited in compiling Unicode property value wildcard subpatterns"
.IX Subsection "Certain pattern matching features are now prohibited in compiling Unicode property value wildcard subpatterns"
These few features are either inappropriate or interfere with the
algorithm used to accomplish this task. The complete list is in
\&\*(L"Wildcards in Property Values\*(R" in perlunicode.

.el .SS "Unused functions \f(CWPOSIX::mbstowcs\fP and \f(CWPOSIX::wcstombs\fP are removed"
.IX Subsection "Unused functions POSIX::mbstowcs and POSIX::wcstombs are removed"
These functions could never have worked due to a defective interface
specification. There is clearly no demand for them, given that no one
has ever complained in the many years the functions were claimed to be
available, hence so-called \*(L"support\*(R" for them is now dropped.

.IX Subsection "A bug fix for (?[...]) may have caused some patterns to no longer compile"
See \*(L"Selected Bug Fixes\*(R". The heuristics previously used may have let
some constructs compile (perhaps not with the programmer's intended
effect) that should have been errors. None are known, but it is
possible that some erroneous constructs no longer compile.
.ie n .SS """\ep{\f(CIuser\-defined\fP}"" properties now always override official Unicode ones"
.el .SS "\f(CW\ep{\fP\f(CIuser\-defined\fP\f(CW}\fP properties now always override official Unicode ones"
.IX Subsection "p{user-defined} properties now always override official Unicode ones"
Previously, if and only if a user-defined property was declared prior to
the compilation of the regular expression pattern that contains it, its
definition was used instead of any official Unicode property with the
same name. Now, it always overrides the official property. This
change could break existing code that relied (likely unwittingly) on the
previous behavior. Without this fix, if Unicode released a new version
with a new property that happens to have the same name as the one you
had long been using, your program would break when you upgraded to a
perl that used that new Unicode version. See \*(L"User-Defined
Character Properties\*(R" in perlunicode. [\s-1GH\s0 #17205 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17205>]

.IX Subsection "Use of vec on strings with code points above 0xFF is forbidden"
Such strings are represented internally in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR is a
bit-oriented operation that will likely give unexpected results on those
strings. This was deprecated in perl 5.28.0.

.ie n .SS "Plain ""0"" string now treated as a number for range operator"
.el .SS "Plain ``0'' string now treated as a number for range operator"
.IX Subsection "Plain 0 string now treated as a number for range operator"
Previously a range \f(CW"0" .. "\-1"\fR would produce a range of numeric
strings from \*(L"0\*(R" through \*(L"99\*(R"; this now produces an empty list, just
as \f(CW\*(C`0 .. \-1\*(C'\fR does. This also means that \f(CW"0" .. "9"\fR now produces a
list of integers, where previously it would produce a list of strings.
.PP
This was due to a special case that treated strings starting with \*(L"0\*(R"
as strings so ranges like \f(CW"00" .. "03"\fR produced \f(CW"00", "01", "02", "03"\fR,
but didn't specially handle the string \f(CW"0"\fR.

This node is like \f(CW\*(C`ANYOFHb\*(C'\fR, but is used when more than one leading byte
is the same in all the matched code points.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`ANYOFHb\*(C'\fR is used to avoid having to convert from \s-1UTF\-8\s0 to code point for
something that won't match. It checks that the first byte in the \s-1UTF\-8\s0

When raised during regular expression pattern compilation, the warning
has extra text added at the end marking where precisely in the pattern
it occurred.

Non-octal character '%c' terminates \eo early.  Resolved as \*(L"%s\*(R"
.Sp
\&...now includes the phrase \*(L"terminates \eo early\*(R", and has extra text added
at the end, when raised during regular expression pattern compilation,
marking where precisely in the pattern it occurred. In some instances
the text of the resolution has been clarified.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&'%s' resolved to '\eo{%s}%d'
.Sp
As of Perl 5.32, this message is no longer generated. Instead,
\&\*(L"Non-octal character '%c' terminates \eo early.  Resolved as \*(R"%s"" in perldiag
is used instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use of code point 0x%s is not allowed; the permissible max is 0x%X
.Sp
Some instances of this message previously output the hex digits \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR,

the line \f(CW\*(C`Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a 32 bit word.\*(C'\fR
as code points that large are no longer legal on 32\-bit platforms.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
This error message has been slightly reformatted from the original \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt use
global %s in "%s"\*(C'\fR, and in particular misleading error messages like \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt
use global $_ in "my"\*(C'\fR are now rendered as \f(CW\*(C`Can\*(Aqt use global $_ in subroutine
signature\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are no longer permitted
.Sp
This error message replaces the former \f(CW\*(C`Constants from lexical variables
potentially modified elsewhere are deprecated. This will not be allowed in Perl
5.32\*(C'\fR to reflect the fact that this previously deprecated usage has now been
transformed into an exception. The message's classification has also been

.Sp
See also \*(L"Incompatible Changes\*(R".
.IP "\(bu" 4

circumstances where previously \f(CW\*(C`\eN{} in inverted character class or as a range

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\*(R"\s0 in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
