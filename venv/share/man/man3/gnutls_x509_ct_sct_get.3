.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_ct_sct_get \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509-ext.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_ct_sct_get(const gnutls_x509_ct_scts_t " scts ", unsigned " idx ", time_t * " timestamp ", gnutls_datum_t * " logid ", gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * " sigalg ", gnutls_datum_t * " signature ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const gnutls_x509_ct_scts_t scts" 12
A list of SCTs
.IP "unsigned idx" 12
The index of the target SCT in the list
.IP "time_t * timestamp" 12
The timestamp of the SCT
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * logid" 12
The LogID field of the SCT; must be freed with \fBgnutls_free()\fP
.IP "gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * sigalg" 12
The signature algorithm
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * signature" 12
The signature of the SCT; must be freed with \fBgnutls_free()\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return a specific SCT (Signed Certificate Timestamp)
stored in the SCT list  \fIscts\fP .

The datums holding the SCT's LogId and signature will be allocated
using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) will be returned on success,
\fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP if  \fIidx\fP exceeds the number of SCTs in the list
or a negative error value.
