.SH NAME
asn1_octet_der \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "void asn1_octet_der(const unsigned char * " str ", int " str_len ", unsigned char * " der ", int * " der_len ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const unsigned char * str" 12
the input data.
.IP "int str_len" 12
STR length (str[0]..str[*str_len\-1]).
.IP "unsigned char * der" 12
encoded string returned.
.IP "int * der_len" 12
number of meaningful bytes of DER (der[0]..der[der_len\-1]).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a length\-value DER encoding for the input data.
The DER encoding of the input data will be placed in the  \fIder\fP variable.

Note that the OCTET STRING tag is not included in the output.

This function does not return any value because it is expected
that  \fIder_len\fP will contain enough bytes to store the string
plus the DER encoding. The DER encoding size can be obtained using
\fBasn1_length_der()\fP.
