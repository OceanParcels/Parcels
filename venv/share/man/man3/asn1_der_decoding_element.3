.SH NAME
asn1_der_decoding_element \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "int asn1_der_decoding_element(asn1_node * " structure ", const char * " elementName ", const void * " ider ", int " len ", char * " errorDescription ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "asn1_node * structure" 12
pointer to an ASN1 structure
.IP "const char * elementName" 12
name of the element to fill
.IP "const void * ider" 12
vector that contains the DER encoding of the whole structure.
.IP "int len" 12
number of bytes of *der: der[0]..der[len\-1]
.IP "char * errorDescription" 12
null\-terminated string contains details when an
error occurred.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fill the element named  \fIELEMENTNAME\fP with values of a DER encoding
string.  The structure must just be created with function
\fBasn1_create_element()\fP.  The DER vector must contain the encoding
string of the whole  \fISTRUCTURE\fP .  If an error occurs during the
decoding procedure, the * \fISTRUCTURE\fP is deleted and set equal to
\fBNULL\fP.

This function is deprecated and may just be an alias to asn1_der_decoding
in future versions. Use \fBasn1_der_decoding()\fP instead.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBASN1_SUCCESS\fP if DER encoding OK, \fBASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND\fP
if ELEMENT is \fBNULL\fP or  \fIelementName\fP == NULL, and
\fBASN1_TAG_ERROR\fP or \fBASN1_DER_ERROR\fP if the der encoding doesn't
match the structure  \fIstructure\fP (*ELEMENT deleted).
