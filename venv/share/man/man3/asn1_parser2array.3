.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "int asn1_parser2array(const char * " inputFileName ", const char * " outputFileName ", const char * " vectorName ", char * " error_desc ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * inputFileName" 12
specify the path and the name of file that
contains ASN.1 declarations.
.IP "const char * outputFileName" 12
specify the path and the name of file that will
contain the C vector definition.
.IP "const char * vectorName" 12
specify the name of the C vector.
.IP "char * error_desc" 12
return the error description or an empty
string if success.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Function that generates a C structure from an ASN1 file.  Creates a
file containing a C vector to use to manage the definitions
included in  \fIinputFileName\fP file. If  \fIinputFileName\fP is
"/aa/bb/xx.yy" and  \fIoutputFileName\fP is \fBNULL\fP, the file created is
"/aa/bb/xx_asn1_tab.c".  If  \fIvectorName\fP is \fBNULL\fP the vector name
will be "xx_asn1_tab".
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBASN1_SUCCESS\fP if the file has a correct syntax and every
identifier is known, \fBASN1_FILE_NOT_FOUND\fP if an error occurred
while opening  \fIinputFileName\fP , \fBASN1_SYNTAX_ERROR\fP if the syntax is
not correct, \fBASN1_IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND\fP if in the file there is
an identifier that is not defined, \fBASN1_NAME_TOO_LONG\fP if in the
file there is an identifier with more than \fBASN1_MAX_NAME_SIZE\fP
