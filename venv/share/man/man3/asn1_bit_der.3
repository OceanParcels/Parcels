.SH NAME
asn1_bit_der \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "void asn1_bit_der(const unsigned char * " str ", int " bit_len ", unsigned char * " der ", int * " der_len ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const unsigned char * str" 12
BIT string.
.IP "int bit_len" 12
number of meaningful bits in STR.
.IP "unsigned char * der" 12
string returned.
.IP "int * der_len" 12
number of meaningful bytes of DER
(der[0]..der[ans_len\-1]).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a length\-value DER encoding for the input data
as it would have been for a BIT STRING.
The DER encoded data will be copied in  \fIder\fP .

Note that the BIT STRING tag is not included in the output.

This function does not return any value because it is expected
that  \fIder_len\fP will contain enough bytes to store the string
plus the DER encoding. The DER encoding size can be obtained using
\fBasn1_length_der()\fP.
