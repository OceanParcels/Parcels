.SH NAME
asn1_der_decoding2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "int asn1_der_decoding2(asn1_node * " element ", const void * " ider ", int * " max_ider_len ", unsigned int " flags ", char * " errorDescription ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "asn1_node * element" 12
pointer to an ASN1 structure.
.IP "const void * ider" 12
vector that contains the DER encoding.
.IP "int * max_ider_len" 12
pointer to an integer giving the information about the
maximal number of bytes occupied by * \fIider\fP . The real size of the DER
encoding is returned through this pointer.
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
flags controlling the behaviour of the function.
.IP "char * errorDescription" 12
null\-terminated string contains details when an
error occurred.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fill the structure * \fIelement\fP with values of a DER encoding string. The
structure must just be created with function \fBasn1_create_element()\fP.

If \fBASN1_DECODE_FLAG_ALLOW_PADDING\fP flag is set then the function will ignore
padding after the decoded DER data. Upon a successful return the value of
* \fImax_ider_len\fP will be set to the number of bytes decoded.

If \fBASN1_DECODE_FLAG_STRICT_DER\fP flag is set then the function will
not decode any BER\-encoded elements.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBASN1_SUCCESS\fP if DER encoding OK, \fBASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND\fP
if  \fIELEMENT\fP is \fBNULL\fP, and \fBASN1_TAG_ERROR\fP or
\fBASN1_DER_ERROR\fP if the der encoding doesn't match the structure
name (* \fIELEMENT\fP deleted).
