.SH NAME
asn1_encode_simple_der \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "int asn1_encode_simple_der(unsigned int " etype ", const unsigned char * " str ", unsigned int " str_len ", unsigned char * " tl ", unsigned int * " tl_len ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "unsigned int etype" 12
The type of the string to be encoded (ASN1_ETYPE_)
.IP "const unsigned char * str" 12
the string data.
.IP "unsigned int str_len" 12
the string length
.IP "unsigned char * tl" 12
the encoded tag and length
.IP "unsigned int * tl_len" 12
the bytes of the  \fItl\fP field
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates the DER encoding for various simple ASN.1 types like strings etc.
It stores the tag and length in  \fItl\fP , which should have space for at least
\fBASN1_MAX_TL_SIZE\fP bytes. Initially  \fItl_len\fP should contain the size of  \fItl\fP .

The complete DER encoding should consist of the value in  \fItl\fP appended
with the provided  \fIstr\fP .
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBASN1_SUCCESS\fP if successful or an error value.
