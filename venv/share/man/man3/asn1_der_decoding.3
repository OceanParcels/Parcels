.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "asn1_node * element" 12
pointer to an ASN1 structure.
.IP "const void * ider" 12
vector that contains the DER encoding.
.IP "int ider_len" 12

historical reasons.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBASN1_SUCCESS\fP if DER encoding OK, \fBASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND\fP
if  \fIELEMENT\fP is \fBNULL\fP, and \fBASN1_TAG_ERROR\fP or
