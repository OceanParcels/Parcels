1 Introduction
**************

   This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and
for manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.

   It consists of the following parts:

‘<unistr.h>’
     elementary string functions
‘<uniconv.h>’
     conversion from/to legacy encodings
‘<unistdio.h>’
     formatted output to strings
‘<uniname.h>’
     character names
‘<unictype.h>’
     character classification and properties
‘<uniwidth.h>’
     string width when using nonproportional fonts
‘<unigbrk.h>’
     grapheme cluster breaks
‘<uniwbrk.h>’
     word breaks
‘<unilbrk.h>’
     line breaking algorithm
‘<uninorm.h>’
     normalization (composition and decomposition)
‘<unicase.h>’
     case folding
‘<uniregex.h>’
     regular expressions (not yet implemented)

   libunistring is for you if your application involves non-trivial text
processing, such as upper/lower case conversions, line breaking,
operations on words, or more advanced analysis of text.  Text provided
by the user can, in general, contain characters of all kinds of scripts.
The text processing functions provided by this library handle all
scripts and all languages.

   libunistring is for you if your application already uses the ISO C /
POSIX ‘<ctype.h>’, ‘<wctype.h>’ functions and the text it operates on is
provided by the user and can be in any language.

   libunistring is also for you if your application uses Unicode strings
as internal in-memory representation.

1.1 Unicode
===========

   Unicode is a standardized repertoire of characters that contains
characters from all scripts of the world, from Latin letters to Chinese
ideographs and Babylonian cuneiform glyphs.  It also specifies how these
characters are to be rendered on a screen or on paper, and how common
text processing (word selection, line breaking, uppercasing of page
titles etc.)  is supposed to behave on Unicode text.

   Unicode also specifies three ways of storing sequences of Unicode
characters in a computer whose basic unit of data is an 8-bit byte:
UTF-8
     Every character is represented as 1 to 4 bytes.
UTF-16
     Every character is represented as 1 to 2 units of 16 bits.
UTF-32, a.k.a. UCS-4
     Every character is represented as 1 unit of 32 bits.

   For encoding Unicode text in a file, UTF-8 is usually used.  For
encoding Unicode strings in memory for a program, either of the three
encoding forms can be reasonably used.

   Unicode is widely used on the web.  Prior to the use of Unicode, web
pages were in many different encodings (ISO-8859-1 for English, French,
Spanish, ISO-8859-2 for Polish, ISO-8859-7 for Greek, KOI8-R for
Russian, GB2312 or BIG5 for Chinese, ISO-2022-JP-2 or EUC-JP or
Shift_JIS for Japanese, and many many others).  It was next to
impossible to create a document that contained Chinese and Polish text
in the same document.  Due to the many encodings for Japanese, even the
processing of pure Japanese text was error prone.

1.2 Unicode and Internationalization
====================================

   Internationalization is the process of changing the source code of a
program so that it can meet the expectations of users in any culture, if
culture specific data (translations, images etc.)  are provided.

   Use of Unicode is not strictly required for internationalization, but
it makes internationalization much easier, because operations that need
to look at specific characters (like hyphenation, spell checking, or the
automatic conversion of double-quotes to opening and closing
double-quote characters) don’t need to consider multiple possible
encodings of the text.

   Use of Unicode also enables multilingualization: the ability of
having text in multiple languages present in the same document or even
in the same line of text.

   But use of Unicode is not everything.  Internationalization usually
consists of four features:
   • Use of Unicode where needed for text processing.  This is what this
     library is for.
   • Use of message catalogs for messages shown to the user, This is
     what GNU gettext is about.
   • Use of locale specific conventions for date and time formats, for
     numeric formatting, or for sorting of text.  This can be done
     adequately with the POSIX APIs and the implementation of locales in
     the GNU C library.
   • In graphical user interfaces, adapting the GUI to the default text
     direction of the current locale (see right-to-left languages
     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left)).

1.3 Locale encodings
====================

   A locale is a set of cultural conventions.  According to POSIX, for a
program, at any moment, there is one locale being designated as the
“current locale”.  (Actually, POSIX supports also one locale per thread,
but this feature is not yet universally implemented and not widely
used.)  The locale is partitioned into several aspects, called the
“categories” of the locale.  The main various aspects are:
   • The character encoding and the character properties.  This is the
     ‘LC_CTYPE’ category.
   • The sorting rules for text.  This is the ‘LC_COLLATE’ category.
   • The language specific translations of messages.  This is the
     ‘LC_MESSAGES’ category.
   • The formatting rules for numbers, such as the decimal separator.
     This is the ‘LC_NUMERIC’ category.
   • The formatting rules for amounts of money.  This is the
     ‘LC_MONETARY’ category.
   • The formatting of date and time.  This is the ‘LC_TIME’ category.

   In particular, the ‘LC_CTYPE’ category of the current locale
determines the character encoding.  This is the encoding of ‘char *’
strings.  We also call it the “locale encoding”.  GNU libunistring has a
function, ‘locale_charset’, that returns a standardized (platform
independent) name for this encoding.

   All locale encodings used on glibc systems are essentially ASCII
compatible: Most graphic ASCII characters have the same representation,
as a single byte, in that encoding as in ASCII.

   Among the possible locale encodings are UTF-8 and GB18030.  Both
allow to represent any Unicode character as a sequence of bytes.  UTF-8
is used in most of the world, whereas GB18030 is used in the People’s
Republic of China, because it is backward compatible with the GB2312
encoding that was used in this country earlier.

   The legacy locale encodings, ISO-8859-15 (which supplanted ISO-8859-1
in most of Europe), ISO-8859-2, KOI8-R, EUC-JP, etc., are still in use
in some places, though.

   UTF-16 and UTF-32 are not used as locale encodings, because they are
not ASCII compatible.

1.4 Choice of in-memory representation of strings
=================================================

   There are three ways of representing strings in memory of a running
program.
   • As ‘char *’ strings.  Such strings are represented in locale
     encoding.  This approach is employed when not much text processing
     is done by the program.  When some Unicode aware processing is to
     be done, a string is converted to Unicode on the fly and back to
     locale encoding afterwards.
   • As UTF-8 or UTF-16 or UTF-32 strings.  This implies that conversion
     from locale encoding to Unicode is performed on input, and in the
     opposite direction on output.  This approach is employed when the
     program does a significant amount of text processing, or when the
     program has multiple threads operating on the same data but in
     different locales.
   • As ‘wchar_t *’, a.k.a.  “wide strings”.  This approach is
     misguided, see *note The wchar_t mess::.

   Of course, a ‘char *’ string can, in some cases, be encoded in UTF-8.
You will use the data type depending on what you can guarantee about how
it’s encoded: If a string is encoded in the locale encoding, or if you
don’t know how it’s encoded, use ‘char *’.  If, on the other hand, you
can _guarantee_ that it is UTF-8 encoded, then you can use the UTF-8
string type, ‘uint8_t *’, for it.

   The five types ‘char *’, ‘uint8_t *’, ‘uint16_t *’, ‘uint32_t *’, and
‘wchar_t *’ are incompatible types at the C level.  Therefore, ‘gcc
-Wall’ will produce a warning if, by mistake, your code contains a
mismatch between these types.  In the context of using GNU libunistring,
even a warning about a mismatch between ‘char *’ and ‘uint8_t *’ is a
sign of a bug in your code that you should not try to silence through a
cast.

1.5 ‘char *’ strings
====================

   The classical C strings, with its C library support standardized by
ISO C and POSIX, can be used in internationalized programs with some
precautions.  The problem with this API is that many of the C library
functions for strings don’t work correctly on strings in locale
encodings, leading to bugs that only people in some cultures of the
world will experience.

   The first problem with the C library API is the support of multibyte
locales.  According to the locale encoding, in general, every character
is represented by one or more bytes (up to 4 bytes in practice — but use
‘MB_LEN_MAX’ instead of the number 4 in the code).  When every character
is represented by only 1 byte, we speak of an “unibyte locale”,
otherwise of a “multibyte locale”.  It is important to realize that the
majority of Unix installations nowadays use UTF-8 or GB18030 as locale
encoding; therefore, the majority of users are using multibyte locales.

   The important fact to remember is:
   _A ‘char’ is a byte, not a character._

   As a consequence:
   • The ‘<ctype.h>’ API is useless in this context; it does not work in
     multibyte locales.
   • The ‘strlen’ function does not return the number of characters in a
     string.  Nor does it return the number of screen columns occupied
     by a string after it is output.  It merely returns the number of
     _bytes_ occupied by a string.
   • Truncating a string, for example, with ‘strncpy’, can have the
     effect of truncating it in the middle of a multibyte character.
     Such a string will, when output, have a garbled character at its
     end, often represented by a hollow box.
   • ‘strchr’ and ‘strrchr’ do not work with multibyte strings if the
     locale encoding is GB18030 and the character to be searched is a
     digit.
   • ‘strstr’ does not work with multibyte strings if the locale
     encoding is different from UTF-8.
   • ‘strcspn’, ‘strpbrk’, ‘strspn’ cannot work correctly in multibyte
     locales: they assume the second argument is a list of single-byte
     characters.  Even in this simple case, they do not work with
     multibyte strings if the locale encoding is GB18030 and one of the
     characters to be searched is a digit.
   • ‘strsep’ and ‘strtok_r’ do not work with multibyte strings unless
     all of the delimiter characters are ASCII characters < 0x30.
   • The ‘strcasecmp’, ‘strncasecmp’, and ‘strcasestr’ functions do not
     work with multibyte strings.

   The workarounds can be found in GNU gnulib
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/>.
   • gnulib has modules ‘mbchar’, ‘mbiter’, ‘mbuiter’ that represent
     multibyte characters and allow to iterate across a multibyte string
     with the same ease as through a unibyte string.
   • gnulib has functions ‘mbslen’ and ‘mbswidth’ that can be used
     instead of ‘strlen’ when the number of characters or the number of
     screen columns of a string is requested.
   • gnulib has functions ‘mbschr’ and ‘mbsrrchr’ that are like ‘strchr’
     and ‘strrchr’, but work in multibyte locales.
   • gnulib has a function ‘mbsstr’, like ‘strstr’, but works in
     multibyte locales.
   • gnulib has functions ‘mbscspn’, ‘mbspbrk’, ‘mbsspn’ that are like
     ‘strcspn’, ‘strpbrk’, ‘strspn’, but work in multibyte locales.
   • gnulib has functions ‘mbssep’ and ‘mbstok_r’ that are like ‘strsep’
     and ‘strtok_r’ but work in multibyte locales.
   • gnulib has functions ‘mbscasecmp’, ‘mbsncasecmp’, ‘mbspcasecmp’,
     and ‘mbscasestr’ that are like ‘strcasecmp’, ‘strncasecmp’, and
     ‘strcasestr’, but work in multibyte locales.  Still, the function
     ‘ulc_casecmp’ is preferable to these functions; see below.

   The second problem with the C library API is that it has some
assumptions built-in that are not valid in some languages:
   • It assumes that there are only two forms of every character:
     uppercase and lowercase.  This is not true for Croatian, where the
     character LETTER DZ WITH CARON comes in three forms: LATIN CAPITAL
     LETTER DZ WITH CARON (DZ), LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER
     Z WITH CARON (Dz), LATIN SMALL LETTER DZ WITH CARON (dz).
   • It assumes that uppercasing of 1 character leads to 1 character.
     This is not true for German, where the LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S,
     when uppercased, becomes ‘SS’.
   • It assumes that there is 1:1 mapping between uppercase and
     lowercase forms.  This is not true for the Greek sigma: GREEK
     CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA is the uppercase of both GREEK SMALL LETTER
     SIGMA and GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA.
   • It assumes that the upper/lowercase mappings are position
     independent.  This is not true for the Greek sigma and the
     Lithuanian i.

   The correct way to deal with this problem is
  1. to provide functions for titlecasing, as well as for upper- and
     lowercasing,
  2. to view case transformations as functions that operates on strings,
     rather than on characters.

   This is implemented in this library, through the functions declared
in ‘<unicase.h>’, see *note unicase.h::.

1.6 Unicode strings
===================

   libunistring supports Unicode strings in three representations:
   • UTF-8 strings, through the type ‘uint8_t *’.  The units are bytes
     (‘uint8_t’).
   • UTF-16 strings, through the type ‘uint16_t *’, The units are 16-bit
     memory words (‘uint16_t’).
   • UTF-32 strings, through the type ‘uint32_t *’.  The units are
     32-bit memory words (‘uint32_t’).

   As with C strings, there are two variants:
   • Unicode strings with a terminating NUL character are represented as
     a pointer to the first unit of the string.  There is a unit
     containing a 0 value at the end.  It is considered part of the
     string for all memory allocation purposes, but is not considered
     part of the string for all other logical purposes.
   • Unicode strings where embedded NUL characters are allowed.  These
     are represented by a pointer to the first unit and the number of
     units (not bytes!)  of the string.  In this setting, there is no
     trailing zero-valued unit used as “end marker”.

2 Conventions
*************

   This chapter explains conventions valid throughout the libunistring
library.

   Variables of type ‘char *’ denote C strings in locale encoding.  See
*note Locale encodings::.

   Variables of type ‘uint8_t *’ denote UTF-8 strings.  Their units are
bytes.

   Variables of type ‘uint16_t *’ denote UTF-16 strings, without byte
order mark.  Their units are 2-byte words.

   Variables of type ‘uint32_t *’ denote UTF-32 strings, without byte
order mark.  Their units are 4-byte words.

   Argument pairs ‘(S, N)’ denote a string ‘S[0..N-1]’ with exactly N
units.

   All functions with prefix ‘ulc_’ operate on C strings in locale
encoding.

   All functions with prefix ‘u8_’ operate on UTF-8 strings.

   All functions with prefix ‘u16_’ operate on UTF-16 strings.

   All functions with prefix ‘u32_’ operate on UTF-32 strings.

   For every function with prefix ‘u8_’, operating on UTF-8 strings,
there is also a corresponding function with prefix ‘u16_’, operating on
UTF-16 strings, and a corresponding function with prefix ‘u32_’,
operating on UTF-32 strings.  Their description is analogous; in this
documentation we describe only the function that operates on UTF-8
strings, for brevity.

   A declaration with a variable N denotes the three concrete
declarations with N = 8, N = 16, N = 32.

   All parameters starting with ‘str’ and the parameters of functions
starting with ‘u8_str’/‘u16_str’/‘u32_str’ denote a NUL terminated
string.

   Error values are always returned through the ‘errno’ variable,
usually with a return value that indicates the presence of an error
(NULL for functions that return an pointer, or -1 for functions that
return an ‘int’).

   Functions returning a string result take a ‘(RESULTBUF, LENGTHP)’
argument pair.  If RESULTBUF is not NULL and the result fits into
‘*LENGTHP’ units, it is put in RESULTBUF, and RESULTBUF is returned.
Otherwise, a freshly allocated string is returned.  In both cases,
‘*LENGTHP’ is set to the length (number of units) of the returned
string.  In case of error, NULL is returned and ‘errno’ is set.

3 Elementary types ‘<unitypes.h>’
*********************************

   The include file ‘<unitypes.h>’ provides the following basic types.

 -- Type: uint8_t
 -- Type: uint16_t
 -- Type: uint32_t
     These are the storage units of UTF-8/16/32 strings, respectively.
     The definitions are taken from ‘<stdint.h>’, on platforms where
     this include file is present.

 -- Type: ucs4_t
     This type represents a single Unicode character, outside of an
     UTF-32 string.

   The types ‘ucs4_t’ and ‘uint32_t’ happen to be identical.  They
differ in use and intent, however:
   • Use ‘uint32_t *’ to designate an UTF-32 string.  Use ‘ucs4_t’ to
     designate a single Unicode character, outside of an UTF-32 string.
   • Conversions functions that take an UTF-32 string as input will
     usually perform a range-check on the ‘uint32_t’ values.  Whereas
     functions that are declared to take ‘ucs4_t’ arguments will not
     perform such a range-check.

4.1 Elementary string checks
============================

   The following function is available to verify the integrity of a
Unicode string.

 -- Function: const uint8_t * u8_check (const uint8_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: const uint16_t * u16_check (const uint16_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: const uint32_t * u32_check (const uint32_t *S, size_t N)
     This function checks whether a Unicode string is well-formed.  It
     returns NULL if valid, or a pointer to the first invalid unit
     otherwise.

4.3.1 Iterating over a Unicode string
-------------------------------------

   The following functions inspect and return details about the first
character in a Unicode string.

 -- Function: int u8_mblen (const uint8_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: int u16_mblen (const uint16_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: int u32_mblen (const uint32_t *S, size_t N)
     Returns the length (number of units) of the first character in S,
     which is no longer than N.  Returns 0 if it is the NUL character.
     Returns -1 upon failure.

     This function is similar to ‘mblen’, except that it operates on a
     Unicode string and that S must not be NULL.

 -- Function: int u8_mbtouc (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint8_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: int u16_mbtouc (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint16_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: int u32_mbtouc (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint32_t *S, size_t N)
     Returns the length (number of units) of the first character in S,
     putting its ‘ucs4_t’ representation in ‘*PUC’.  Upon failure,
     ‘*PUC’ is set to ‘0xfffd’, and an appropriate number of units is
     returned.

     The number of available units, N, must be > 0.

     This function fails if an invalid sequence of units is encountered
     at the beginning of S, or if additional units (after the N provided
     units) would be needed to form a character.

     This function is similar to ‘mbtowc’, except that it operates on a
     Unicode string, PUC and S must not be NULL, N must be > 0, and the
     NUL character is not treated specially.

 -- Function: int u8_mbtouc_unsafe (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint8_t *S,
          size_t N)
 -- Function: int u16_mbtouc_unsafe (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint16_t *S,
          size_t N)
 -- Function: int u32_mbtouc_unsafe (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint32_t *S,
          size_t N)
     This function is identical to
     ‘u8_mbtouc’/‘u16_mbtouc’/‘u32_mbtouc’.  Earlier versions of this
     function performed fewer range-checks on the sequence of units.

 -- Function: int u8_mbtoucr (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint8_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: int u16_mbtoucr (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint16_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: int u32_mbtoucr (ucs4_t *PUC, const uint32_t *S, size_t N)
     Returns the length (number of units) of the first character in S,
     putting its ‘ucs4_t’ representation in ‘*PUC’.  Upon failure,
     ‘*PUC’ is set to ‘0xfffd’, and -1 is returned for an invalid
     sequence of units, -2 is returned for an incomplete sequence of
     units.

     The number of available units, N, must be > 0.

     This function is similar to ‘u8_mbtouc’, except that the return
     value gives more details about the failure, similar to ‘mbrtowc’.

4.3.2 Creating Unicode strings one character at a time
------------------------------------------------------

   The following function stores a Unicode character as a Unicode string
in memory.

 -- Function: int u8_uctomb (uint8_t *S, ucs4_t UC, int N)
 -- Function: int u16_uctomb (uint16_t *S, ucs4_t UC, int N)
 -- Function: int u32_uctomb (uint32_t *S, ucs4_t UC, int N)
     Puts the multibyte character represented by UC in S, returning its
     length.  Returns -1 upon failure, -2 if the number of available
     units, N, is too small.  The latter case cannot occur if N >=
     6/2/1, respectively.

     This function is similar to ‘wctomb’, except that it operates on a
     Unicode strings, S must not be NULL, and the argument N must be
     specified.

4.3.3 Copying Unicode strings
-----------------------------

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_cpy (uint8_t *DEST, const uint8_t *SRC,
          size_t N)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_cpy (uint16_t *DEST, const uint16_t *SRC,
          size_t N)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_cpy (uint32_t *DEST, const uint32_t *SRC,
          size_t N)
     Copies N units from SRC to DEST.

     This function is similar to ‘memcpy’, except that it operates on
     Unicode strings.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_move (uint8_t *DEST, const uint8_t *SRC,
          size_t N)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_move (uint16_t *DEST, const uint16_t *SRC,
          size_t N)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_move (uint32_t *DEST, const uint32_t *SRC,
          size_t N)
     Copies N units from SRC to DEST, guaranteeing correct behavior for
     overlapping memory areas.

     This function is similar to ‘memmove’, except that it operates on
     Unicode strings.

   The following function fills a Unicode string.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_set (uint8_t *S, ucs4_t UC, size_t N)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_set (uint16_t *S, ucs4_t UC, size_t N)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_set (uint32_t *S, ucs4_t UC, size_t N)
     Sets the first N characters of S to UC.  UC should be a character
     that occupies only 1 unit.

     This function is similar to ‘memset’, except that it operates on
     Unicode strings.

 -- Function: int u32_cmp (const uint32_t *S1, const uint32_t *S2,
          size_t N)
     Compares S1 and S2, each of length N, lexicographically.  Returns a
     negative value if S1 compares smaller than S2, a positive value if
     S1 compares larger than S2, or 0 if they compare equal.

     This function is similar to ‘memcmp’, except that it operates on
     Unicode strings.

   The following function compares two Unicode strings of possibly
different lengths.

 -- Function: int u8_cmp2 (const uint8_t *S1, size_t N1, const uint8_t
          *S2, size_t N2)
 -- Function: int u16_cmp2 (const uint16_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint16_t *S2, size_t N2)
 -- Function: int u32_cmp2 (const uint32_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint32_t *S2, size_t N2)

     S1 compares smaller than S2, a positive value if S1 compares larger
     than S2, or 0 if they compare equal.

     sets ‘errno’ and returns any value.

     This function is similar to ‘strcoll’ and ‘wcscoll’, except that it
     operates on Unicode strings.

     Note that this function may consider different canonical
     normalizations of the same string as having a large distance.  It
     is therefore better to use the function ‘u8_normcoll’ instead of
     this one; see *note uninorm.h::.

4.5.8 Tokenizing a NUL terminated Unicode string
------------------------------------------------

   The following function does one step in tokenizing a Unicode string.

5 Conversions between Unicode and encodings ‘<uniconv.h>’
*********************************************************

   This include file declares functions for converting between Unicode
strings and ‘char *’ strings in locale encoding or in other specified
encodings.

   The following function returns the locale encoding.

 -- Function: const char * locale_charset ()
     Determines the current locale’s character encoding, and
     canonicalizes it into one of the canonical names listed in
     ‘config.charset’.  If the canonical name cannot be determined, the
     result is a non-canonical name.

     The result must not be freed; it is statically allocated.

     The result of this function can be used as an argument to the
     ‘iconv_open’ function in GNU libc, in GNU libiconv, or in the
     gnulib provided wrapper around the native ‘iconv_open’ function.
     It may not work as an argument to the native ‘iconv_open’ function
     directly.

   The handling of unconvertible characters during the conversions can
be parametrized through the following enumeration type:

 -- Type: enum iconv_ilseq_handler
     This type specifies how unconvertible characters in the input are
     handled.

 -- Constant: enum iconv_ilseq_handler iconveh_error
     This handler causes the function to return with ‘errno’ set to
     ‘EILSEQ’.

 -- Constant: enum iconv_ilseq_handler iconveh_question_mark
     This handler produces one question mark ‘?’ per unconvertible
     character.

 -- Constant: enum iconv_ilseq_handler iconveh_escape_sequence
     This handler produces an escape sequence ‘\uXXXX’ or ‘\UXXXXXXXX’
     for each unconvertible character.

   The following functions convert between strings in a specified
encoding and Unicode strings.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_conv_from_encoding (const char *FROMCODE,
          enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER, const char *SRC, size_t
          SRCLEN, size_t *OFFSETS, uint8_t *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_conv_from_encoding (const char *FROMCODE,
          enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER, const char *SRC, size_t
          SRCLEN, size_t *OFFSETS, uint16_t *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_conv_from_encoding (const char *FROMCODE,
          enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER, const char *SRC, size_t
          SRCLEN, size_t *OFFSETS, uint32_t *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
     Converts an entire string, possibly including NUL bytes, from one
     encoding to UTF-8 encoding.

     Converts a memory region given in encoding FROMCODE.  FROMCODE is
     as for the ‘iconv_open’ function.

     The input is in the memory region between SRC (inclusive) and ‘SRC
     + SRCLEN’ (exclusive).

     If OFFSETS is not NULL, it should point to an array of SRCLEN
     integers; this array is filled with offsets into the result, i.e.
     the character starting at ‘SRC[i]’ corresponds to the character
     starting at ‘RESULT[OFFSETS[i]]’, and other offsets are set to
     ‘(size_t)(-1)’.

     ‘RESULTBUF’ and ‘*LENGTHP’ should be a scratch buffer and its size,
     or ‘RESULTBUF’ can be NULL.

     May erase the contents of the memory at ‘RESULTBUF’.

     If successful: The resulting Unicode string (non-NULL) is returned
     and its length stored in ‘*LENGTHP’.  The resulting string is
     ‘RESULTBUF’ if no dynamic memory allocation was necessary, or a
     freshly allocated memory block otherwise.

     In case of error: NULL is returned and ‘errno’ is set.  Particular
     ‘errno’ values: ‘EINVAL’, ‘EILSEQ’, ‘ENOMEM’.

 -- Function: char * u8_conv_to_encoding (const char *TOCODE, enum
          iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER, const uint8_t *SRC, size_t
          SRCLEN, size_t *OFFSETS, char *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: char * u16_conv_to_encoding (const char *TOCODE, enum
          iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER, const uint16_t *SRC, size_t
          SRCLEN, size_t *OFFSETS, char *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: char * u32_conv_to_encoding (const char *TOCODE, enum
          iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER, const uint32_t *SRC, size_t
          SRCLEN, size_t *OFFSETS, char *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
     Converts an entire Unicode string, possibly including NUL units,
     from UTF-8 encoding to a given encoding.

     Converts a memory region to encoding TOCODE.  TOCODE is as for the
     ‘iconv_open’ function.

     The input is in the memory region between SRC (inclusive) and ‘SRC
     + SRCLEN’ (exclusive).

     If OFFSETS is not NULL, it should point to an array of SRCLEN
     integers; this array is filled with offsets into the result, i.e.
     the character starting at ‘SRC[i]’ corresponds to the character
     starting at ‘RESULT[OFFSETS[i]]’, and other offsets are set to
     ‘(size_t)(-1)’.

     ‘RESULTBUF’ and ‘*LENGTHP’ should be a scratch buffer and its size,
     or ‘RESULTBUF’ can be NULL.

     May erase the contents of the memory at ‘RESULTBUF’.

     If successful: The resulting Unicode string (non-NULL) is returned
     and its length stored in ‘*LENGTHP’.  The resulting string is
     ‘RESULTBUF’ if no dynamic memory allocation was necessary, or a
     freshly allocated memory block otherwise.

     In case of error: NULL is returned and ‘errno’ is set.  Particular
     ‘errno’ values: ‘EINVAL’, ‘EILSEQ’, ‘ENOMEM’.

   The following functions convert between NUL terminated strings in a
specified encoding and NUL terminated Unicode strings.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_strconv_from_encoding (const char *STRING,
          const char *FROMCODE, enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_strconv_from_encoding (const char *STRING,
          const char *FROMCODE, enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_strconv_from_encoding (const char *STRING,
          const char *FROMCODE, enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER)
     Converts a NUL terminated string from a given encoding.

     The result is ‘malloc’ allocated, or NULL (with ERRNO set) in case
     of error.

     Particular ‘errno’ values: ‘EILSEQ’, ‘ENOMEM’.

 -- Function: char * u8_strconv_to_encoding (const uint8_t *STRING,
          const char *TOCODE, enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER)
 -- Function: char * u16_strconv_to_encoding (const uint16_t *STRING,
          const char *TOCODE, enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER)
 -- Function: char * u32_strconv_to_encoding (const uint32_t *STRING,
          const char *TOCODE, enum iconv_ilseq_handler HANDLER)
     Converts a NUL terminated string to a given encoding.

     The result is ‘malloc’ allocated, or NULL (with ‘errno’ set) in
     case of error.

     Particular ‘errno’ values: ‘EILSEQ’, ‘ENOMEM’.

   The following functions are shorthands that convert between NUL
terminated strings in locale encoding and NUL terminated Unicode
strings.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_strconv_from_locale (const char *STRING)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_strconv_from_locale (const char *STRING)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_strconv_from_locale (const char *STRING)

6 Output with Unicode strings ‘<unistdio.h>’
********************************************

   This include file declares functions for doing formatted output with
Unicode strings.  It defines a set of functions similar to ‘fprintf’ and
‘sprintf’, which are declared in ‘<stdio.h>’.

   These functions work like the ‘printf’ function family.  In the
format string:
   • The format directive ‘U’ takes an UTF-8 string (‘const uint8_t *’).
   • The format directive ‘lU’ takes an UTF-16 string (‘const uint16_t
     *’).
   • The format directive ‘llU’ takes an UTF-32 string (‘const uint32_t
     *’).

   A function name with an infix ‘v’ indicates that a ‘va_list’ is
passed instead of multiple arguments.

   The functions ‘*sprintf’ have a BUF argument that is assumed to be
large enough.  (_DANGEROUS! Overflowing the buffer will crash the
program._)

   The functions ‘*snprintf’ have a BUF argument that is assumed to be
SIZE units large.  (_DANGEROUS! The resulting string might be truncated
in the middle of a multibyte character._)

   The functions ‘*asprintf’ have a RESULTP argument.  The result will
be freshly allocated and stored in ‘*resultp’.

   The functions ‘*asnprintf’ have a (RESULTBUF, LENGTHP) argument pair.
If RESULTBUF is not NULL and the result fits into ‘*LENGTHP’ units, it
is put in RESULTBUF, and RESULTBUF is returned.  Otherwise, a freshly
allocated string is returned.  In both cases, ‘*LENGTHP’ is set to the
length (number of units) of the returned string.  In case of error, NULL
is returned and ‘errno’ is set.

   The following functions take an ASCII format string and return a
result that is a ‘char *’ string in locale encoding.

 -- Function: int ulc_sprintf (char *BUF, const char *FORMAT, ...)

          *FORMAT, ...)

7 Names of Unicode characters ‘<uniname.h>’
*******************************************

   This include file implements the association between a Unicode
character and its name.

   The name of a Unicode character allows to distinguish it from other,
similar looking characters.  For example, the character ‘x’ has the name
‘"LATIN SMALL LETTER X"’ and is therefore different from the character
named ‘"MULTIPLICATION SIGN"’.

 -- Macro: unsigned int UNINAME_MAX
     This macro expands to a constant that is the required size of
     buffer for a Unicode character name.

 -- Function: char * unicode_character_name (ucs4_t UC, char *BUF)
     Looks up the name of a Unicode character, in uppercase ASCII. BUF
     must point to a buffer, at least ‘UNINAME_MAX’ bytes in size.
     Returns the filled BUF, or NULL if the character does not have a
     name.

 -- Function: ucs4_t unicode_name_character (const char *NAME)
     Looks up the Unicode character with a given name, in upper- or
     lowercase ASCII. NAME can also be an alias name of a character.
     Returns the character if found, or ‘UNINAME_INVALID’ if not found.

 -- Macro: ucs4_t UNINAME_INVALID
     This macro expands to a constant that is a special return value of
     the ‘unicode_name_character’ function.

8 Unicode character classification and properties ‘<unictype.h>’
****************************************************************

   This include file declares functions that classify Unicode characters
and that test whether Unicode characters have specific properties.

   The classification assigns a “general category” to every Unicode
character.  This is similar to the classification provided by ISO C in
‘<wctype.h>’.

   Properties are the data that guides various text processing
algorithms in the presence of specific Unicode characters.

8.1 General category
====================

   Every Unicode character or code point has a _general category_
assigned to it.  This classification is important for most algorithms
that work on Unicode text.

   The GNU libunistring library provides two kinds of API for working
with general categories.  The object oriented API uses a variable to
denote every predefined general category value or combinations thereof.
The low-level API uses a bit mask instead.  The advantage of the object
oriented API is that if only a few predefined general category values
are used, the data tables are relatively small.  When you combine
general category values (using ‘uc_general_category_or’,
‘uc_general_category_and’, or ‘uc_general_category_and_not’), or when
you use the low level bit masks, a big table is used thats holds the
complete general category information for all Unicode characters.

8.1.1 The object oriented API for general category
--------------------------------------------------

 -- Type: uc_general_category_t
     This data type denotes a general category value.  It is an
     immediate type that can be copied by simple assignment, without
     involving memory allocation.  It is not an array type.

   The following are the predefined general category value.  Additional
general categories may be added in the future.

   The ‘UC_CATEGORY_*’ constants reflect the systematic general category
values assigned by the Unicode Consortium.  Whereas the other ‘UC_*’

8.2 Canonical combining class
=============================

   Every Unicode character or code point has a _canonical combining
class_ assigned to it.

   What is the meaning of the canonical combining class?  Essentially,
it indicates the priority with which a combining character is attached
to its base character.  The characters for which the canonical combining
class is 0 are the base characters, and the characters for which it is
greater than 0 are the combining characters.  Combining characters are
rendered near/attached/around their base character, and combining
characters with small combining classes are attached "first" or "closer"
to the base character.

   The canonical combining class of a character is a number in the range
0..255.  The possible values are described in the Unicode Character
Database <http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UCD.html>.  The list
here is not definitive; more values can be added in future versions.

 -- Constant: int UC_CCC_NR
     The canonical combining class value for “Not Reordered” characters.
     The value is 0.

     the abbreviated name.  Returns NULL if the canonical combining
     class is a numeric value without a name.

     Returns the canonical combining class given by name, e.g.  ‘"BL"’,
     or by long name, e.g.  ‘"Below Left"’.  This lookup ignores spaces,
     underscores, or hyphens as word separators and is
     case-insignificant.

8.9 Properties
==============

   This section defines boolean properties of Unicode characters.  This
means, a character either has the given property or does not have it.
In other words, the property can be viewed as a subset of the set of
Unicode characters.

   The GNU libunistring library provides two kinds of API for working
with properties.  The object oriented API uses a type ‘uc_property_t’ to
designate a property.  In the function-based API, which is a bit more
low level, a property is merely a function.

* Menu:

* Properties as objects::
* Properties as functions::

 -- Function: uc_property_t uc_property_byname (const char
          *PROPERTY_NAME)
     Returns the property given by name, e.g.  ‘"White space"’.  If a
     property with the given name exists, the result will satisfy the
     ‘uc_property_is_valid’ predicate.  Otherwise the result will not
     satisfy this predicate and must not be passed to functions that
     expect an ‘uc_property_t’ argument.

     This lookup ignores spaces, underscores, or hyphens as word
     separators, is case-insignificant, and supports the aliases listed
     in Unicode’s ‘PropertyAliases.txt’ file.

     This function references a big table of all predefined properties.
     Its use can significantly increase the size of your application.

     allocated data.  It contains the following fields:
          ucs4_t start;
          ucs4_t end;
          const char *name;

     The ‘start’ field is the first Unicode code point in the block.

     The ‘end’ field is the last Unicode code point in the block.

8.13 Classifications like in ISO C
==================================

   The following character classifications mimic those declared in the
ISO C header files ‘<ctype.h>’ and ‘<wctype.h>’.  These functions are
deprecated, because this set of functions was designed with ASCII in
mind and cannot reflect the more diverse reality of the Unicode
character set.  But they can be a quick-and-dirty porting aid when
migrating from ‘wchar_t’ APIs to Unicode strings.

 -- Function: bool uc_is_alnum (ucs4_t UC)

     Tests for any character for which ‘uc_is_upper’ or ‘uc_is_lower’ is
     true, or any character that is one of a locale-specific set of
     characters for which none of ‘uc_is_cntrl’, ‘uc_is_digit’,
     ‘uc_is_punct’, or ‘uc_is_space’ is true.

     ‘uc_is_space’ is false.

 -- Function: bool uc_is_lower (ucs4_t UC)
     Tests for any character that corresponds to a lowercase letter or
     is one of a locale-specific set of characters for which none of
     ‘uc_is_cntrl’, ‘uc_is_digit’, ‘uc_is_punct’, or ‘uc_is_space’ is
     true.

 -- Function: bool uc_is_print (ucs4_t UC)
     Tests for any printing character.

 -- Function: bool uc_is_punct (ucs4_t UC)

     set of characters for which neither ‘uc_is_space’ nor ‘uc_is_alnum’
     is true.

 -- Function: bool uc_is_space (ucs4_t UC)
     Test for any character that corresponds to a locale-specific set of

9 Display width ‘<uniwidth.h>’
******************************

   This include file declares functions that return the display width,
measured in columns, of characters or strings, when output to a device
that uses non-proportional fonts.

   Note that for some rarely used characters the actual fonts or
terminal emulators can use a different width.  There is no mechanism for
communicating the display width of characters across a Unix
pseudo-terminal (tty).  Also, there are scripts with complex rendering,
like the Indic scripts.  For these scripts, there is no such concept as
non-proportional fonts.  Therefore the results of these functions
usually work fine on most scripts and on most characters but can fail to
represent the actual display width.

   These functions are locale dependent.  The ENCODING argument
identifies the encoding (e.g.  ‘"ISO-8859-2"’ for Polish).

 -- Function: int uc_width (ucs4_t UC, const char *ENCODING)
     Determines and returns the number of column positions required for
     UC.  Returns -1 if UC is a control character that has an influence
     on the column position when output.

 -- Function: int u8_width (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const char
          *ENCODING)
 -- Function: int u16_width (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const char
          *ENCODING)
 -- Function: int u32_width (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const char
          *ENCODING)
     Determines and returns the number of column positions required for
     first N units (or fewer if S ends before this) in S.  This function
     ignores control characters in the string.

 -- Function: int u8_strwidth (const uint8_t *S, const char *ENCODING)
 -- Function: int u16_strwidth (const uint16_t *S, const char *ENCODING)
 -- Function: int u32_strwidth (const uint32_t *S, const char *ENCODING)
     Determines and returns the number of column positions required for
     S.  This function ignores control characters in the string.

10 Grapheme cluster breaks in strings ‘<unigbrk.h>’
***************************************************

   This include file declares functions for determining where in a
string “grapheme clusters” start and end.  A “grapheme cluster” is an
approximation to a user-perceived character, which sometimes corresponds
to multiple Unicode characters.  Editing operations such as mouse
selection, cursor movement, and backspacing often operate on grapheme
clusters as units, not on individual characters.

   Some grapheme clusters are built from a base character and a
combining character.  The letter ‘é’, for example, is most commonly
represented in Unicode as a single character U+00E8 LATIN SMALL LETTER E
WITH ACUTE. It is, however, equally valid to use the pair of characters
U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E followed by U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT.
Since the user would perceive this pair of characters as a single
character, they would be grouped into a single grapheme cluster.

   But there are also grapheme clusters that consist of several base
characters.  For example, a Devanagari letter and a Devanagari vowel
sign that follows it may form a grapheme cluster.  Similarly, some pairs
of Thai characters and Hangul syllables (formed by two or three Hangul
characters) are grapheme clusters.

10.1 Grapheme cluster breaks in a string
========================================

   The following functions find a single boundary between grapheme
clusters in a string.

 -- Function: void u8_grapheme_next (const uint8_t *S, const uint8_t
          *END)
 -- Function: void u16_grapheme_next (const uint16_t *S, const uint16_t
          *END)
 -- Function: void u32_grapheme_next (const uint32_t *S, const uint32_t
          *END)
     Returns the start of the next grapheme cluster following S, or END
     if no grapheme cluster break is encountered before it.  Returns
     NULL if and only if ‘S == END’.

     Note that these functions do not handle the case when a character
     outside of the range between S and END is needed to determine the
     boundary.  Use ‘_grapheme_breaks’ functions for such cases.

 -- Function: void u8_grapheme_prev (const uint8_t *S, const uint8_t
          *START)
 -- Function: void u16_grapheme_prev (const uint16_t *S, const uint16_t
          *START)
 -- Function: void u32_grapheme_prev (const uint32_t *S, const uint32_t
          *START)
     Returns the start of the grapheme cluster preceding S, or START if
     no grapheme cluster break is encountered before it.  Returns NULL
     if and only if ‘S == START’.

     Note that these functions do not handle the case when a character
     outside of the range between START and S is needed to determine the
     boundary.  Use ‘_grapheme_breaks’ functions for such cases.

   The following functions determine all of the grapheme cluster
boundaries in a string.

 -- Function: void u8_grapheme_breaks (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, char
          *P)
 -- Function: void u16_grapheme_breaks (const uint16_t *S, size_t N,
          char *P)
 -- Function: void u32_grapheme_breaks (const uint32_t *S, size_t N,
          char *P)
 -- Function: void ulc_grapheme_breaks (const char *S, size_t N, char
          *P)
 -- Function: void uc_grapheme_breaks (const ucs_t *S, size_t N, char
          *P)
     Determines the grapheme cluster break points in S, an array of N
     units, and stores the result at ‘P[0..NX-1]’.
     ‘P[i] = 1’
          means that there is a grapheme cluster boundary between
          ‘S[i-1]’ and ‘S[i]’.
     ‘P[i] = 0’
          means that ‘S[i-1]’ and ‘S[i]’ are part of the same grapheme
          cluster.
     ‘P[0]’ is always set to 1, because there is always a grapheme
     cluster break at start of text.

     In addition to the above variants for UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32
     strings, ‘<unigbrk.h>’ provides another variant:
     ‘uc_grapheme_breaks’.

     This is similar to ‘u32_grapheme_breaks’, but it accepts any
     characters which may not be represented in UTF-32, such as control
     characters.

10.2 Grapheme cluster break property
====================================

   This is a more low-level API. The grapheme cluster break property is
a property defined in Unicode Standard Annex #29, section “Grapheme
Cluster Boundaries”, see
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries>.  It
is used for determining the grapheme cluster breaks in a string.

   The following are the possible values of the grapheme cluster break
property.  More values may be added in the future.

 -- Constant: int GBP_OTHER
 -- Constant: int GBP_CR
 -- Constant: int GBP_LF
 -- Constant: int GBP_CONTROL
 -- Constant: int GBP_EXTEND
 -- Constant: int GBP_PREPEND
 -- Constant: int GBP_SPACINGMARK
 -- Constant: int GBP_L
 -- Constant: int GBP_V
 -- Constant: int GBP_T
 -- Constant: int GBP_LV
 -- Constant: int GBP_LVT
 -- Constant: int GBP_RI
 -- Constant: int GBP_ZWJ
 -- Constant: int GBP_EB
 -- Constant: int GBP_EM
 -- Constant: int GBP_GAZ
 -- Constant: int GBP_EBG

   The following function looks up the grapheme cluster break property
of a character.

 -- Function: int uc_graphemeclusterbreak_property (ucs4_t UC)
     Returns the Grapheme_Cluster_Break property of a Unicode character.

   The following function determines whether there is a grapheme cluster
break between two Unicode characters.  It is the primitive upon which
the higher-level functions in the previous section are directly based.

 -- Function: bool uc_is_grapheme_break (ucs4_t A, ucs4_t B)
     Returns true if there is an grapheme cluster boundary between
     Unicode characters A and B.

     There is always a grapheme cluster break at the start or end of
     text.  You can specify zero for A or B to indicate start of text or
     end of text, respectively.

     This implements the extended (not legacy) grapheme cluster rules
     described in the Unicode standard, because the standard says that
     they are preferred.

     Note that this function does not handle the case when three or more
     consecutive characters are needed to determine the boundary.  Use
     ‘uc_grapheme_breaks’ for such cases.

11 Word breaks in strings ‘<uniwbrk.h>’
***************************************

   This include file declares functions for determining where in a
string “words” start and end.  Here “words” are not necessarily the same
as entities that can be looked up in dictionaries, but rather groups of
consecutive characters that should not be split by text processing
operations.

11.1 Word breaks in a string
============================

   The following functions determine the word breaks in a string.

 -- Function: void u8_wordbreaks (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, char *P)
 -- Function: void u16_wordbreaks (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, char *P)
 -- Function: void u32_wordbreaks (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, char *P)
 -- Function: void ulc_wordbreaks (const char *S, size_t N, char *P)
     Determines the word break points in S, an array of N units, and
     stores the result at ‘P[0..N-1]’.
     ‘P[i] = 1’
          means that there is a word boundary between ‘S[i-1]’ and
          ‘S[i]’.
     ‘P[i] = 0’
          means that ‘S[i-1]’ and ‘S[i]’ must not be separated.
     ‘P[0]’ is always set to 0.  If an application wants to consider a
     word break to be present at the beginning of the string (before
     ‘S[0]’) or at the end of the string (after ‘S[0..N-1]’), it has to
     treat these cases explicitly.

12 Line breaking ‘<unilbrk.h>’
******************************

   This include file declares functions for determining where in a
string line breaks could or should be introduced, in order to make the
displayed string fit into a column of given width.

   These functions are locale dependent.  The ENCODING argument
identifies the encoding (e.g.  ‘"ISO-8859-2"’ for Polish).

   The following enumerated values indicate whether, at a given
position, a line break is possible or not.  Given an string S as an
array ‘S[0..N-1]’ and a position I, the values have the following
meanings:

 -- Constant: int UC_BREAK_MANDATORY
     This value indicates that ‘S[I]’ is a line break character.

 -- Constant: int UC_BREAK_POSSIBLE
     This value indicates that a line break may be inserted between
     ‘S[I-1]’ and ‘S[I]’.

 -- Constant: int UC_BREAK_HYPHENATION
     This value indicates that a hyphen and a line break may be inserted
     between ‘S[I-1]’ and ‘S[I]’.  But beware of language dependent
     hyphenation rules.

 -- Constant: int UC_BREAK_PROHIBITED
     This value indicates that ‘S[I-1]’ and ‘S[I]’ must not be
     separated.

 -- Constant: int UC_BREAK_UNDEFINED
     This value is not used as a return value; rather, in the overriding
     argument of the ‘u*_width_linebreaks’ functions, it indicates the
     absence of an override.

   The following functions determine the positions at which line breaks
are possible.

 -- Function: void u8_possible_linebreaks (const uint8_t *S, size_t N,
          const char *ENCODING, char *P)
 -- Function: void u16_possible_linebreaks (const uint16_t *S, size_t N,
          const char *ENCODING, char *P)
 -- Function: void u32_possible_linebreaks (const uint32_t *S, size_t N,
          const char *ENCODING, char *P)
 -- Function: void ulc_possible_linebreaks (const char *S, size_t N,
          const char *ENCODING, char *P)
     Determines the line break points in S, and stores the result at
     ‘P[0..N-1]’.  Every ‘P[I]’ is assigned one of the values
     ‘UC_BREAK_MANDATORY’, ‘UC_BREAK_POSSIBLE’, ‘UC_BREAK_HYPHENATION’,
     ‘UC_BREAK_PROHIBITED’.

   The following functions determine where line breaks should be
inserted so that each line fits in a given width, when output to a
device that uses non-proportional fonts.

 -- Function: int u8_width_linebreaks (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, int
          WIDTH, int START_COLUMN, int AT_END_COLUMNS, const char
          *OVERRIDE, const char *ENCODING, char *P)
 -- Function: int u16_width_linebreaks (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, int
          WIDTH, int START_COLUMN, int AT_END_COLUMNS, const char
          *OVERRIDE, const char *ENCODING, char *P)
 -- Function: int u32_width_linebreaks (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, int
          WIDTH, int START_COLUMN, int AT_END_COLUMNS, const char
          *OVERRIDE, const char *ENCODING, char *P)
 -- Function: int ulc_width_linebreaks (const char *S, size_t N, int
          WIDTH, int START_COLUMN, int AT_END_COLUMNS, const char
          *OVERRIDE, const char *ENCODING, char *P)
     Chooses the best line breaks, assuming that every character
     occupies a width given by the ‘uc_width’ function (see *note
     uniwidth.h::).

     The string is ‘S[0..N-1]’.

     The maximum number of columns per line is given as WIDTH.  The
     starting column of the string is given as START_COLUMN.  If the
     algorithm shall keep room after the last piece, this amount of room
     can be given as AT_END_COLUMNS.

     OVERRIDE is an optional override; if ‘OVERRIDE[I] !=
     UC_BREAK_UNDEFINED’, ‘OVERRIDE[I]’ takes precedence over ‘P[I]’ as
     returned by the ‘u*_possible_linebreaks’ function.

     The given ENCODING is used for disambiguating widths in ‘uc_width’.

     Returns the column after the end of the string, and stores the
     result at ‘P[0..N-1]’.  Every ‘P[I]’ is assigned one of the values
     ‘UC_BREAK_MANDATORY’, ‘UC_BREAK_POSSIBLE’, ‘UC_BREAK_HYPHENATION’,
     ‘UC_BREAK_PROHIBITED’.  Here the value ‘UC_BREAK_POSSIBLE’
     indicates that a line break _should_ be inserted.

decomposition of a Unicode character.

 -- Constant: int UC_DECOMP_CANONICAL
     Denotes canonical decomposition.

     UCD marker: ‘<noBreak>’.  Denotes a no-break version of a space or
     hyphen.

 -- Constant: int UC_DECOMP_INITIAL

     UCD marker: ‘<vertical>’.  Denotes a vertical layout presentation
     form.

 -- Constant: int UC_DECOMP_WIDE
     UCD marker: ‘<wide>’.  Denotes a wide (or zenkaku) compatibility
     character.

 -- Constant: int UC_DECOMP_NARROW
     UCD marker: ‘<narrow>’.  Denotes a narrow (or hankaku)
     compatibility character.

 -- Constant: int UC_DECOMP_SMALL
     UCD marker: ‘<small>’.  Denotes a small variant form (CNS
     compatibility).

     UCD marker: ‘<square>’.  Denotes a CJK squared font variant.

 -- Constant: int UC_DECOMP_FRACTION
     UCD marker: ‘<fraction>’.  Denotes a vulgar fraction form.

 -- Constant: int UC_DECOMP_COMPAT
     UCD marker: ‘<compat>’.  Denotes an otherwise unspecified
     compatibility character.

   The following constant denotes the maximum size of decomposition of a
single Unicode character.

 -- Macro: unsigned int UC_DECOMPOSITION_MAX_LENGTH
     This macro expands to a constant that is the required size of
     buffer passed to the ‘uc_decomposition’ and
     ‘uc_canonical_decomposition’ functions.

   The following functions decompose a Unicode character.

 -- Function: int uc_decomposition (ucs4_t UC, int *DECOMP_TAG, ucs4_t
          *DECOMPOSITION)
     Returns the character decomposition mapping of the Unicode
     character UC.  DECOMPOSITION must point to an array of at least
     ‘UC_DECOMPOSITION_MAX_LENGTH’ ‘ucs_t’ elements.

     When a decomposition exists, ‘DECOMPOSITION[0..N-1]’ and
     ‘*DECOMP_TAG’ are filled and N is returned.  Otherwise -1 is
     returned.

 -- Function: int uc_canonical_decomposition (ucs4_t UC, ucs4_t
          *DECOMPOSITION)
     Returns the canonical character decomposition mapping of the
     Unicode character UC.  DECOMPOSITION must point to an array of at
     least ‘UC_DECOMPOSITION_MAX_LENGTH’ ‘ucs_t’ elements.

     When a decomposition exists, ‘DECOMPOSITION[0..N-1]’ is filled and
     N is returned.  Otherwise -1 is returned.

     Note: This function returns the (simple) “canonical decomposition”
     of UC.  If you want the “full canonical decomposition” of UC, that
     is, the recursive application of “canonical decomposition”, use the
     function ‘u*_normalize’ with argument ‘UNINORM_NFD’ instead.

   The following function composes a Unicode character from two Unicode
characters.

 -- Function: ucs4_t uc_composition (ucs4_t UC1, ucs4_t UC2)
     Attempts to combine the Unicode characters UC1, UC2.  UC1 is known
     to have canonical combining class 0.

     Returns the combination of UC1 and UC2, if it exists.  Returns 0
     otherwise.

     Not all decompositions can be recombined using this function.  See
     the Unicode file ‘CompositionExclusions.txt’ for details.

13.3 Normalization of strings
=============================

   The Unicode standard defines four normalization forms for Unicode
strings.  The following type is used to denote a normalization form.

 -- Type: uninorm_t
     An object of type ‘uninorm_t’ denotes a Unicode normalization form.
     This is a scalar type; its values can be compared with ‘==’.

   The following constants denote the four normalization forms.

 -- Macro: uninorm_t UNINORM_NFD
     Denotes Normalization form D: canonical decomposition.

 -- Macro: uninorm_t UNINORM_NFC
     Normalization form C: canonical decomposition, then canonical
     composition.

 -- Macro: uninorm_t UNINORM_NFKD
     Normalization form KD: compatibility decomposition.

 -- Macro: uninorm_t UNINORM_NFKC
     Normalization form KC: compatibility decomposition, then canonical
     composition.

   The following functions operate on ‘uninorm_t’ objects.

 -- Function: bool uninorm_is_compat_decomposing (uninorm_t NF)
     Tests whether the normalization form NF does compatibility
     decomposition.

 -- Function: bool uninorm_is_composing (uninorm_t NF)
     Tests whether the normalization form NF includes canonical
     composition.

 -- Function: uninorm_t uninorm_decomposing_form (uninorm_t NF)
     Returns the decomposing variant of the normalization form NF.  This
     maps NFC,NFD → NFD and NFKC,NFKD → NFKD.

   The following functions apply a Unicode normalization form to a
Unicode string.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_normalize (uninorm_t NF, const uint8_t *S,
          size_t N, uint8_t *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_normalize (uninorm_t NF, const uint16_t *S,
          size_t N, uint16_t *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_normalize (uninorm_t NF, const uint32_t *S,
          size_t N, uint32_t *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
     Returns the specified normalization form of a string.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.


File: libunistring.info,  Node: Normalizing comparisons,  Next: Normalization of streams,  Prev: Normalization of strings,  Up: uninorm.h

13.4 Normalizing comparisons
============================

   The following functions compare Unicode string, ignoring differences
in normalization.

 -- Function: int u8_normcmp (const uint8_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint8_t *S2, size_t N2, uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_normcmp (const uint16_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint16_t *S2, size_t N2, uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_normcmp (const uint32_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint32_t *S2, size_t N2, uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
     Compares S1 and S2, ignoring differences in normalization.

     NF must be either ‘UNINORM_NFD’ or ‘UNINORM_NFKD’.

     If successful, sets ‘*RESULTP’ to -1 if S1 < S2, 0 if S1 = S2, 1 if
     S1 > S2, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns -1 with ‘errno’ set.

 -- Function: char * u8_normxfrm (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, uninorm_t
          NF, char *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: char * u16_normxfrm (const uint16_t *S, size_t N,
          uninorm_t NF, char *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: char * u32_normxfrm (const uint32_t *S, size_t N,
          uninorm_t NF, char *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
     Converts the string S of length N to a NUL-terminated byte
     sequence, in such a way that comparing ‘u8_normxfrm (S1)’ and
     ‘u8_normxfrm (S2)’ with the ‘u8_cmp2’ function is equivalent to
     comparing S1 and S2 with the ‘u8_normcoll’ function.

     NF must be either ‘UNINORM_NFC’ or ‘UNINORM_NFKC’.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: int u8_normcoll (const uint8_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint8_t *S2, size_t N2, uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_normcoll (const uint16_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint16_t *S2, size_t N2, uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_normcoll (const uint32_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint32_t *S2, size_t N2, uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
     Compares S1 and S2, ignoring differences in normalization, using
     the collation rules of the current locale.

     NF must be either ‘UNINORM_NFC’ or ‘UNINORM_NFKC’.

     If successful, sets ‘*RESULTP’ to -1 if S1 < S2, 0 if S1 = S2, 1 if
     S1 > S2, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns -1 with ‘errno’ set.

===================================================

   A “stream of Unicode characters” is essentially a function that
accepts an ‘ucs4_t’ argument repeatedly, optionally combined with a
function that “flushes” the stream.

 -- Type: struct uninorm_filter
     This is the data type of a stream of Unicode characters that
     normalizes its input according to a given normalization form and
     passes the normalized character sequence to the encapsulated stream
     of Unicode characters.

 -- Function: struct uninorm_filter * uninorm_filter_create (uninorm_t
          NF, int (*STREAM_FUNC) (void *STREAM_DATA, ucs4_t UC), void
          *STREAM_DATA)
     Creates and returns a normalization filter for Unicode characters.

     The pair (STREAM_FUNC, STREAM_DATA) is the encapsulated stream.
     ‘STREAM_FUNC (STREAM_DATA, UC)’ receives the Unicode character UC
     and returns 0 if successful, or -1 with ‘errno’ set upon failure.

     Returns the new filter, or NULL with ‘errno’ set upon failure.

 -- Function: int uninorm_filter_write (struct uninorm_filter *FILTER,
          ucs4_t UC)
     Stuffs a Unicode character into a normalizing filter.  Returns 0 if
     successful, or -1 with ‘errno’ set upon failure.

 -- Function: int uninorm_filter_flush (struct uninorm_filter *FILTER)
     Brings data buffered in the filter to its destination, the
     encapsulated stream.

     Returns 0 if successful, or -1 with ‘errno’ set upon failure.

     Note!  If after calling this function, additional characters are
     written into the filter, the resulting character sequence in the
     encapsulated stream will not necessarily be normalized.

 -- Function: int uninorm_filter_free (struct uninorm_filter *FILTER)
     Brings data buffered in the filter to its destination, the
     encapsulated stream, then closes and frees the filter.

     Returns 0 if successful, or -1 with ‘errno’ set upon failure.

14 Case mappings ‘<unicase.h>’
******************************

   This include file defines functions for case mapping for Unicode
strings and case insensitive comparison of Unicode strings and C
strings.

   These string functions fix the problems that were mentioned in *note
char * strings::, namely, they handle the Croatian LETTER DZ WITH CARON,
the German LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S, the Greek sigma and the
Lithuanian i correctly.

14.1 Case mappings of characters
================================

   The following functions implement case mappings on Unicode characters
— for those cases only where the result of the mapping is a again a
single Unicode character.

   These mappings are locale and context independent.

   *WARNING!* These functions are not sufficient for languages such as
German, Greek and Lithuanian.  Better use the functions below that treat
an entire string at once and are language aware.

 -- Function: ucs4_t uc_toupper (ucs4_t UC)
     Returns the uppercase mapping of the Unicode character UC.

 -- Function: ucs4_t uc_tolower (ucs4_t UC)
     Returns the lowercase mapping of the Unicode character UC.

 -- Function: ucs4_t uc_totitle (ucs4_t UC)
     Returns the titlecase mapping of the Unicode character UC.

     The titlecase mapping of a character is to be used when the
     character should look like upper case and the following characters
     are lower cased.

     For most characters, this is the same as the uppercase mapping.
     There are only few characters where the title case variant and the
     uuper case variant are different.  These characters occur in the
     Latin writing of the Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian languages.

     Lower case             Title case             Upper case
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

14.2 Case mappings of strings
=============================

   Case mapping should always be performed on entire strings, not on
individual characters.  The functions in this sections do so.

   These functions allow to apply a normalization after the case
mapping.  The reason is that if you want to treat ‘ä’ and ‘Ä’ the same,
you most often also want to treat the composed and decomposed forms of
such a character, U+00C4 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS and
U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS the same.  The
NF argument designates the normalization.

   These functions are locale dependent.  The ISO639_LANGUAGE argument
identifies the language (e.g.  ‘"tr"’ for Turkish).  NULL means to use
locale independent case mappings.

 -- Function: const char * uc_locale_language ()
     Returns the ISO 639 language code of the current locale.  Returns
     ‘""’ if it is unknown, or in the "C" locale.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_toupper (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint8_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_toupper (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint16_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_toupper (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint32_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
     Returns the uppercase mapping of a string.

     The NF argument identifies the normalization form to apply after
     the case-mapping.  It can also be NULL, for no normalization.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_tolower (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint8_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_tolower (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint16_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_tolower (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint32_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
     Returns the lowercase mapping of a string.

     The NF argument identifies the normalization form to apply after
     the case-mapping.  It can also be NULL, for no normalization.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_totitle (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint8_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_totitle (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint16_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_totitle (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint32_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
     Returns the titlecase mapping of a string.

     Mapping to title case means that, in each word, the first cased
     character is being mapped to title case and the remaining
     characters of the word are being mapped to lower case.

     The NF argument identifies the normalization form to apply after
     the case-mapping.  It can also be NULL, for no normalization.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

14.3 Case mappings of substrings
================================

   Case mapping of a substring cannot simply be performed by extracting
the substring and then applying the case mapping function to it.  This
does not work because case mapping requires some information about the
surrounding characters.  The following functions allow to apply case
mappings to substrings of a given string, while taking into account the
characters that precede it (the “prefix”) and the characters that follow
it (the “suffix”).

 -- Type: casing_prefix_context_t
     This data type denotes the case-mapping context that is given by a
     prefix string.  It is an immediate type that can be copied by
     simple assignment, without involving memory allocation.  It is not
     an array type.

 -- Constant: casing_prefix_context_t unicase_empty_prefix_context
     This constant is the case-mapping context that corresponds to an
     empty prefix string.

   The following functions return ‘casing_prefix_context_t’ objects:

 -- Function: casing_prefix_context_t u8_casing_prefix_context (const
          uint8_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: casing_prefix_context_t u16_casing_prefix_context (const
          uint16_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: casing_prefix_context_t u32_casing_prefix_context (const
          uint32_t *S, size_t N)
     Returns the case-mapping context of a given prefix string.

 -- Function: casing_prefix_context_t u8_casing_prefixes_context (const
          uint8_t *S, size_t N, casing_prefix_context_t A_CONTEXT)
 -- Function: casing_prefix_context_t u16_casing_prefixes_context (const
          uint16_t *S, size_t N, casing_prefix_context_t A_CONTEXT)
 -- Function: casing_prefix_context_t u32_casing_prefixes_context (const
          uint32_t *S, size_t N, casing_prefix_context_t A_CONTEXT)
     Returns the case-mapping context of the prefix concat(A, S), given
     the case-mapping context of the prefix A.

 -- Type: casing_suffix_context_t
     This data type denotes the case-mapping context that is given by a
     suffix string.  It is an immediate type that can be copied by
     simple assignment, without involving memory allocation.  It is not
     an array type.

 -- Constant: casing_suffix_context_t unicase_empty_suffix_context
     This constant is the case-mapping context that corresponds to an
     empty suffix string.

   The following functions return ‘casing_suffix_context_t’ objects:

 -- Function: casing_suffix_context_t u8_casing_suffix_context (const
          uint8_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: casing_suffix_context_t u16_casing_suffix_context (const
          uint16_t *S, size_t N)
 -- Function: casing_suffix_context_t u32_casing_suffix_context (const
          uint32_t *S, size_t N)
     Returns the case-mapping context of a given suffix string.

 -- Function: casing_suffix_context_t u8_casing_suffixes_context (const
          uint8_t *S, size_t N, casing_suffix_context_t A_CONTEXT)
 -- Function: casing_suffix_context_t u16_casing_suffixes_context (const
          uint16_t *S, size_t N, casing_suffix_context_t A_CONTEXT)
 -- Function: casing_suffix_context_t u32_casing_suffixes_context (const
          uint32_t *S, size_t N, casing_suffix_context_t A_CONTEXT)
     Returns the case-mapping context of the suffix concat(S, A), given
     the case-mapping context of the suffix A.

   The following functions perform a case mapping, considering the
prefix context and the suffix context.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_ct_toupper (const uint8_t *S, size_t N,
          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint8_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_ct_toupper (const uint16_t *S, size_t N,
          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint16_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)

          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint32_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
     Returns the uppercase mapping of a string that is surrounded by a
     prefix and a suffix.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_ct_tolower (const uint8_t *S, size_t N,
          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char

          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint32_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
     Returns the lowercase mapping of a string that is surrounded by a
     prefix and a suffix.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_ct_totitle (const uint8_t *S, size_t N,
          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint8_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_ct_totitle (const uint16_t *S, size_t N,

          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint16_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_ct_totitle (const uint32_t *S, size_t N,

     prefix and a suffix.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter

   For example, to uppercase the UTF-8 substring between ‘s +
start_index’ and ‘s + end_index’ of a string that extends from ‘s’ to ‘s
+ u8_strlen (s)’, you can use the statements

     size_t result_length;
     uint8_t result =
       u8_ct_toupper (s + start_index, end_index - start_index,
                      u8_casing_prefix_context (s, start_index),
                      u8_casing_suffix_context (s + end_index,
                                                u8_strlen (s) - end_index),
                      iso639_language, NULL, NULL, &result_length);

14.4 Case insensitive comparison
================================

   The following functions implement comparison that ignores differences
in case and normalization.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_casefold (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint8_t *RESULTBUF,
          size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_casefold (const uint16_t *S, size_t N,
          const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint16_t
          *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_casefold (const uint32_t *S, size_t N,
          const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint32_t
          *RESULTBUF, size_t *LENGTHP)
     Returns the case folded string.

     Comparing ‘u8_casefold (S1)’ and ‘u8_casefold (S2)’ with the
     ‘u8_cmp2’ function is equivalent to comparing S1 and S2 with
     ‘u8_casecmp’.

     The NF argument identifies the normalization form to apply after
     the case-mapping.  It can also be NULL, for no normalization.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: uint8_t * u8_ct_casefold (const uint8_t *S, size_t N,
          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint8_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint16_t * u16_ct_casefold (const uint16_t *S, size_t N,
          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint16_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: uint32_t * u32_ct_casefold (const uint32_t *S, size_t N,
          casing_prefix_context_t PREFIX_CONTEXT,
          casing_suffix_context_t SUFFIX_CONTEXT, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, uint32_t *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
     Returns the case folded string.  The case folding takes into
     account the case mapping contexts of the prefix and suffix strings.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: int u8_casecmp (const uint8_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint8_t *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t
          NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_casecmp (const uint16_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint16_t *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE,
          uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_casecmp (const uint32_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint32_t *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE,
          uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int ulc_casecmp (const char *S1, size_t N1, const char
          *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, int
          *RESULTP)
     Compares S1 and S2, ignoring differences in case and normalization.

     The NF argument identifies the normalization form to apply after
     the case-mapping.  It can also be NULL, for no normalization.

     If successful, sets ‘*RESULTP’ to -1 if S1 < S2, 0 if S1 = S2, 1 if
     S1 > S2, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns -1 with ‘errno’ set.

   The following functions additionally take into account the sorting
rules of the current locale.

 -- Function: char * u8_casexfrm (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, char *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: char * u16_casexfrm (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, char *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: char * u32_casexfrm (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, char *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
 -- Function: char * ulc_casexfrm (const char *S, size_t N, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, char *RESULTBUF, size_t
          *LENGTHP)
     Converts the string S of length N to a NUL-terminated byte
     sequence, in such a way that comparing ‘u8_casexfrm (S1)’ and
     ‘u8_casexfrm (S2)’ with the gnulib function ‘memcmp2’ is equivalent
     to comparing S1 and S2 with ‘u8_casecoll’.

     NF must be either ‘UNINORM_NFC’, ‘UNINORM_NFKC’, or NULL for no
     normalization.

     The RESULTBUF and LENGTHP arguments are as described in chapter
     *note Conventions::.

 -- Function: int u8_casecoll (const uint8_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint8_t *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t
          NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_casecoll (const uint16_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint16_t *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE,
          uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_casecoll (const uint32_t *S1, size_t N1, const
          uint32_t *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE,
          uninorm_t NF, int *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int ulc_casecoll (const char *S1, size_t N1, const char
          *S2, size_t N2, const char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, uninorm_t NF, int
          *RESULTP)
     Compares S1 and S2, ignoring differences in case and normalization,
     using the collation rules of the current locale.

     The NF argument identifies the normalization form to apply after
     the case-mapping.  It must be either ‘UNINORM_NFC’ or
     ‘UNINORM_NFKC’.  It can also be NULL, for no normalization.

     If successful, sets ‘*RESULTP’ to -1 if S1 < S2, 0 if S1 = S2, 1 if
     S1 > S2, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns -1 with ‘errno’ set.

14.5 Case detection
===================

   The following functions determine whether a Unicode string is
entirely in upper case.  or entirely in lower case, or entirely in title
case, or already case-folded.

 -- Function: int u8_is_uppercase (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_is_uppercase (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_is_uppercase (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
     Sets ‘*RESULTP’ to true if mapping NFD(S) to upper case is a no-op,
     or to false otherwise, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns -1
     with ‘errno’ set.

 -- Function: int u8_is_lowercase (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_is_lowercase (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_is_lowercase (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
     Sets ‘*RESULTP’ to true if mapping NFD(S) to lower case is a no-op,
     or to false otherwise, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns -1
     with ‘errno’ set.

 -- Function: int u8_is_titlecase (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_is_titlecase (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_is_titlecase (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
     Sets ‘*RESULTP’ to true if mapping NFD(S) to title case is a no-op,
     or to false otherwise, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns -1
     with ‘errno’ set.

 -- Function: int u8_is_casefolded (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_is_casefolded (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_is_casefolded (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const
          char *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
     Sets ‘*RESULTP’ to true if applying case folding to NFD(S) is a
     no-op, or to false otherwise, and returns 0.  Upon failure, returns
     -1 with ‘errno’ set.

   The following functions determine whether case mappings have any
effect on a Unicode string.

 -- Function: int u8_is_cased (const uint8_t *S, size_t N, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u16_is_cased (const uint16_t *S, size_t N, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
 -- Function: int u32_is_cased (const uint32_t *S, size_t N, const char
          *ISO639_LANGUAGE, bool *RESULTP)
     Sets ‘*RESULTP’ to true if case matters for S, that is, if mapping
     NFD(S) to either upper case or lower case or title case is not a
     no-op.  Set ‘*RESULTP’ to false if NFD(S) maps to itself under the
     upper case mapping, under the lower case mapping, and under the
     title case mapping; in other words, when NFD(S) consists entirely
     of caseless characters.  Upon failure, returns -1 with ‘errno’ set.

********************

   This chapter explains some practical considerations, regarding the
installation and compiler options that are needed in order to use this
library.

File: libunistring.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Compiler options,  Up: Using the library

16.1 Installation
=================

   Before you can use the library, it must be installed.  First, you
have to make sure all dependencies are installed.  They are listed in
the file ‘DEPENDENCIES’.

   Then you can proceed to build and install the library, as described
in the file ‘INSTALL’.  For installation on Windows systems, please
refer to the file ‘INSTALL.windows’.


File: libunistring.info,  Node: Compiler options,  Next: Include files,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Using the library

16.2 Compiler options
=====================

   Let’s denote as ‘LIBUNISTRING_PREFIX’ the value of the ‘--prefix’
option that you passed to ‘configure’ while installing this package.  If
you didn’t pass any ‘--prefix’ option, then the package is installed in
‘/usr/local’.

   Let’s denote as ‘LIBUNISTRING_INCLUDEDIR’ the directory where the
include files were installed.  This is usually the same as
‘${LIBUNISTRING_PREFIX}/include’.  Except that if you passed an
‘--includedir’ option to ‘configure’, it is the value of that option.

   Let’s further denote as ‘LIBUNISTRING_LIBDIR’ the directory where the
library itself was installed.  This is the value that you passed with
the ‘--libdir’ option to ‘configure’, or otherwise the same as
‘${LIBUNISTRING_PREFIX}/lib’.  Recall that when building in 64-bit mode
on a 64-bit GNU/Linux system that supports executables in either 64-bit
mode or 32-bit mode, you should have used the option
‘--libdir=${LIBUNISTRING_PREFIX}/lib64’.

   So that the compiler finds the include files, you have to pass it the
option ‘-I${LIBUNISTRING_INCLUDEDIR}’.

   So that the compiler finds the library during its linking pass, you
have to pass it the options ‘-L${LIBUNISTRING_LIBDIR} -lunistring’.  On
some systems, in some configurations, you also have to pass options
needed for linking with ‘libiconv’.  The autoconf macro
‘gl_LIBUNISTRING’ (see *note Autoconf macro::) deals with this
particularity.


File: libunistring.info,  Node: Include files,  Next: Autoconf macro,  Prev: Compiler options,  Up: Using the library

16.3 Include files
==================

   Most of the include files have been presented in the introduction,
see *note Introduction::, and subsequent detailed chapters.

   Another include file is ‘<unistring/version.h>’.  It contains the
version number of the libunistring library.

 -- Macro: int _LIBUNISTRING_VERSION
     This constant contains the version of libunistring that is being
     used at compile time.  It encodes the major and minor parts of the
     version number only.  These parts are encoded in the form
     ‘(major<<8) + minor’.

 -- Constant: int _libunistring_version
     This constant contains the version of libunistring that is being
     used at run time.  It encodes the major and minor parts of the
     version number only.  These parts are encoded in the form
     ‘(major<<8) + minor’.

   It is possible that ‘_libunistring_version’ is greater than
‘_LIBUNISTRING_VERSION’.  This can happen when you use ‘libunistring’ as
a shared library, and a newer, binary backward-compatible version has
been installed after your program that uses ‘libunistring’ was
installed.


File: libunistring.info,  Node: Autoconf macro,  Next: Reporting problems,  Prev: Include files,  Up: Using the library

16.4 Autoconf macro
===================

   GNU Gnulib provides an autoconf macro that tests for the availability
of ‘libunistring’.  It is contained in the Gnulib module ‘libunistring’,
see
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/MODULES.html#module=libunistring>.

   The macro is called ‘gl_LIBUNISTRING’.  It searches for an installed
libunistring.  If found, it sets and AC_SUBSTs ‘HAVE_LIBUNISTRING=yes’
and the ‘LIBUNISTRING’ and ‘LTLIBUNISTRING’ variables and augments the
‘CPPFLAGS’ variable, and defines the C macro ‘HAVE_LIBUNISTRING’ to 1.
Otherwise, it sets and AC_SUBSTs ‘HAVE_LIBUNISTRING=no’ and
‘LIBUNISTRING’ and ‘LTLIBUNISTRING’ to empty.

   The complexities that ‘gl_LIBUNISTRING’ deals with are the following:

   • On some operating systems, in some configurations, libunistring
     depends on ‘libiconv’, and the options for linking with libiconv
     must be mentioned explicitly on the link command line.

   • GNU ‘libunistring’, if installed, is not necessarily already in the
     search path (‘CPPFLAGS’ for the include file search path, ‘LDFLAGS’
     for the library search path).

   • GNU ‘libunistring’, if installed, is not necessarily already in the
     run time library search path.  To avoid the need for setting an
     environment variable like ‘LD_LIBRARY_PATH’, the macro adds the
     appropriate run time search path options to the ‘LIBUNISTRING’
     variable.  This works on most systems.

16.5 Reporting problems
=======================

   If you encounter any problem, please don’t hesitate to send a
detailed bug report to the ‘bug-libunistring@gnu.org’ mailing list.  You
can alternatively also use the bug tracker at the project page
<https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/libunistring>.

   Please always include the version number of this library, and a short
description of your operating system and compilation environment with
corresponding version numbers.

   For problems that appear while building and installing
‘libunistring’, for which you don’t find the remedy in the ‘INSTALL’
file, please include a description of the options that you passed to the
‘configure’ script.

Appendix A The ‘wchar_t’ mess
*****************************

   The ISO C and POSIX standard creators made an attempt to fix the
first problem mentioned in the section *note char * strings::.  They
introduced
   • a type ‘wchar_t’, designed to encapsulate an entire character,
   • a “wide string” type ‘wchar_t *’, and
   • functions declared in ‘<wctype.h>’ that were meant to supplant the
     ones in ‘<ctype.h>’.

   Unfortunately, this API and its implementation has numerous problems:

   • On AIX and Windows platforms, ‘wchar_t’ is a 16-bit type.  This
     means that it can never accommodate an entire Unicode character.
     Either the ‘wchar_t *’ strings are limited to characters in UCS-2
     (the “Basic Multilingual Plane” of Unicode), or — if ‘wchar_t *’
     strings are encoded in UTF-16 — a ‘wchar_t’ represents only half of
     a character in the worst case, making the ‘<wctype.h>’ functions
     pointless.

   • On Solaris and FreeBSD, the ‘wchar_t’ encoding is locale dependent
     and undocumented.  This means, if you want to know any property of
     a ‘wchar_t’ character, other than the properties defined by
     ‘<wctype.h>’ — such as whether it’s a dash, currency symbol,
     paragraph separator, or similar —, you have to convert it to ‘char
     *’ encoding first, by use of the function ‘wctomb’.

   • When you read a stream of wide characters, through the functions
     ‘fgetwc’ and ‘fgetws’, and when the input stream/file is not in the
     expected encoding, you have no way to determine the invalid byte
     sequence and do some corrective action.  If you use these
     functions, your program becomes “garbage in - more garbage out” or
     “garbage in - abort”.

   As a consequence, it is better to use multibyte strings, as explained
in the section *note char * strings::.  Such multibyte strings can
bypass limitations of the ‘wchar_t’ type, if you use functions defined
in gnulib and libunistring for text processing.  They can also
faithfully transport malformed characters that were present in the
input, without requiring the program to produce garbage or abort.

B.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==============================

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
     “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

     To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified
     version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

     A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
     restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor
     version”.

     A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, “control”
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To “grant”
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

B.2 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
=====================================

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

     As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU
     Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version
     3 of the GNU General Public License.

     “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
     other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

     An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface
     provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
     Library.  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is
     deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

     A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
     Application with the Library.  The particular version of the
     Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the
     “Linked Version”.

     The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
     Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source
     code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
     isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked
     Version.

     The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
     object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
     data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
     from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
     Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
     License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
     facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an
     Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument
     passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
     the modified version:

       a. under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
          to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply
          the function or data, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

       b. under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
          this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material
     from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey
     such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
     incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions
     and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
     following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.
       b. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
          license document.

  4. Combined Works.

     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
     taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
     portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each
     of the following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.
       b. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and
          this license document.
       c. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
          these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to
          the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
       d. Do one of the following:

            0. Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
               of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
               in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the
               user to recombine or relink the Application with a
               modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
               modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by
               section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
               Source.
            1. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
               the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses
               at run time a copy of the Library already present on the
               user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly
               with a modified version of the Library that is
               interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

       e. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
          otherwise be required to provide such information under
          section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
          information is necessary to install and execute a modified
          version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
          relinking the Application with a modified version of the
          Linked Version.  (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
          Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source
          and Corresponding Application Code.  If you use option 4d1,
          you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
          specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
          Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side by side in a single library together with other
     library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by
     this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
     your choice, if you do both of the following:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of
          it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
          find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to
     time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
     version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later
     version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
     and conditions either of that published version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library
     as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
     Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the
     GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free
     Software Foundation.

     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
     whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
     shall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any
     version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version
     for the Library.

B.3 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
